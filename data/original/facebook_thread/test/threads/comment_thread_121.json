I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.  Anyone who knows me, know these words don't reflect who I am.\n\nI said it, it was wrong, and I apologize.\n\nI've travelled the country talking about change for America. But my travels have also changed me.  I've spent time with grieving mothers who've lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I've been humbled by the faith they've placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down.\nLet's be honest.  We're living in the real world.  This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today.  We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were 8 years ago and Washington is broken.\nHillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground.\n\nI've said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days.\n\nSee you at the debate on Sunday."

    "text": "Thank you for that sincere apology. I could care less what you said all those years ago. None of us are perfect. I only care that you apologized BECAUSE AMERICA NEEDS YOU!!!!! I know some wanted to hear this. As a mother that lost her daughter what Hillary said to a 12 year old rape victim ( now that I care about ) It shows me she will do anything, step on anyone to get up one more step on the ladder. It also makes me believe she has no empathy. I am watching our wonderful country disappear before my eyes. I know for a fact you will bring this great nation back up from her knees.... Thank you from the bottom of my heart for stepping up to the plate to try to help us get our Country back...."

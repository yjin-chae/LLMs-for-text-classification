But we are talking about HUGE disparities in issues such as climate change, a woman's right to choose, immigration, health care, minimum wage and the SUPREME FREAKING COURT. So, to your point, a \"liar\" - as you believe her to be - is nowhere near as dangerous as a racist, sexiest, demagogue maniac."

    "text": "Donald Trump speaks so casually about deporting American citizens against their will, it is frightening. Any child born on US soil is an American citizen with the rights and freedoms of an American citizens. If Donald Trump believe differently, regarding the rights of US citizen as outlined in the Constitution, then the last place this man needs to be is in the White House. And if you are one of those in support of this man who can decide who is or is not a citizen, be very careful, your status may be determined no longer legal next under this poor excuse for a Presidential candidate."

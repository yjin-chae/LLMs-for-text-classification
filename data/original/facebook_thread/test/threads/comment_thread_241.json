    "text": "It's funny, on the other hand, Trump complains that Clinton is getting donated by the Wallstreet, and what is Mr. Trump? It's incredible how mendacious they are. Since he wants to hire one from the Wallstreet as a finance minister, I can only say it goes on as before, the high finance determines what has to run. Whoever thinks normally comes to the conclusion: Nobody neither Trump nor Clinton would be good presidents. What an armistice."

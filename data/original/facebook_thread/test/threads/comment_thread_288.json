    "text": "Ok, let me get this straight. Whether it's Putin, anonymous, China or any other hacktivist that is sharing information with wiki leaks, Hillary basically admited in a non direct way that the information is correct but did a good job deflecting the attention by bringing up someone interfering with the election. No matter how the information is found, it shows how corrupt she is and how many lies she told. Donald needs to call her out on admitting the information being true. If she says the information isn't true, then call her out for lying about the hacking even happening because apparently the information is incorrect that is being put out there and the hacker apparently isn't good at their job. Who cares how her devious lies are found out, as long as they are found out and the truth is shared."

      "text": "I already told you that politics is not something we should discuss... Your opinions are gained through an entirely different set of circumstances than mine. I lost friends at war, and know first hand what has happened, because I was serving my country when they occurred... My beliefs are formed from what I've seen with my own eyes, not by what someone told me, or what a media outlet showed on TV.. I think sometimes you forget that not only was I military, but also LE, and went to college while working full time. I'm not swayed by opinions, or propaganda, I've got the education, and sense, to formulate my position from facts ..... When you come back from Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya or any of the other dozen or more countries that I had to spend time in, defending our country's interests (mission trips aren't the same), we can discuss the many reasons that I will never ever support Hillary Clinton. She may become president, but I will never raise a hand in salute to her, to do so would be the equivalent of pissing on the graves of many great men and women.... Enough said, let's leave politics off the discussion table"

      "text": "I know exactly what Trump has said, because he can definitely be an idiot when he speaks, at times....what you don't see anywhere online or on the news is the hundreds of times he has done things far and above what could ever be expected for military members and veterans... He may say the wrong things, but his actions speak a completely different language.... He is extremely pro-veteran, and pro-military.... It is not Trump that I personally want, but he will appoint the proper people to handle the jobs that need to be done, not bring all his cronies in to reward them for being good lap dogs... Our government needs to be handled more like a business if it will ever get turned around"

      "text": "The problem, sweetie, is that everything is being manipulated for context.... It's so easy to do nowadays.... And there is no \"truth\" to be found in any of these ads... You actually have to go back and watch all the raw footage of the interviews to see what was really said or meant... The clip where they make it look like Trump was making fun of a disabled reporter is totally skewed, if you go back and watch the whole thing... And the hand gestures he used that they make look like he was using mockingly, are the same gestures he used in another interview when he was describing someone else who was backtracking on something they said that was ridiculous.... Like I say, it's all about context, and the American public are sheep... They don't want to have to check to see if anything is true, it's easier to just believe what they see on TV"

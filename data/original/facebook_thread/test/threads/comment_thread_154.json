      "text": "This is our last chance, Friend, Right now, Trump for President is airing hard-hitting, issues-based TV ads in key media markets, promoting Mr. Trump's plans to Make America Great Again while exposing the lobbyists, Crooked Hillary and all the other politicians who've made the system work only for them and against you. The American people are starving for this kind of message, and if enough people hear directly from Mr. Trump about his plans for the future, we're going to win on November 8. +2348138734922 whatsApp. Please send as many SMS to your friends!!!"

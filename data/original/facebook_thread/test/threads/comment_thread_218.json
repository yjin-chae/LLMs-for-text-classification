      "text": "Racism: While Hillary was vying for the Democratic nomination in 2008, she ran an attack ad against Barack Obama that many deemed to be racist. Clinton also claimed that she had strong support from \"hard working Americans, white Americans.\" In the 1990s, while touting racist crime policies, she said that young black men are \"super predators\" who should be brought \"to heel\", which she later regretted. She was also an early supporter of Goldwater's presidential campaign (he pushed the racist Southern Strategy and advocated against the Civil Rights Act). Finally, Clinton actively utilized racist rhetoric to defend her husband's welfare reform in 1996."

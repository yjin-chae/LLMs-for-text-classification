    "text": "Our monthly premium for Obamacare in Illinois is going up from $1,000 a month to $1,600 a month with $6,500 deductible per person/$13,000 family max. This is the \"cheapest\" plan offered. In addition to our monthly premium, we pay in full, out of our own pocket every doctor appt and prescription. We are a healthy family of five that will go bankrupt paying for catastrophe only insurance. Seeing a doctor is just too expensive when you are already paying $1,600 a month for \"insurance.\" My family has a $1,600 a month reason to vote November 8th."

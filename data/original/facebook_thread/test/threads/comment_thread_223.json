Her money comes from contributions and speaking engagements. No jobs created there. I would love to hear her plan on how she intends to fight terrorism and build our economy. I think she will just bash her opponent and offer no real solutions."

      "text": "doing it. Maybe you can help me. How many jobs had she created? How many people does she employ? I see she has championed social programs. That does not create jobs to help people to provide for their families so they don't need those programs. I see the Clinton foundation sends money overseas to help people. What about taking care of your own first? Am I wrong about how the Clinton's have amassed their wealth? Help me out. Is it not through donations, speaking engagements and government jobs? I'll do some more research on that. When I cast my vote I want it to be for the best candidate. I am willing to keep an open mind and urge others to do the same."

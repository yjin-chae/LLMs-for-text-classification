Maybe you need to wake up and look at Hillary and the DNC threw a few dollars at mentally ill people to disrupt rallies and now massive voter fraud . IF YOU SERIOUSLY want truth, please watch this and then ask yourself why so many reporters scared to report on this???? PLEASE WAKE UP PEOPLE, THIS IS TERRIBLE!!!!! These are the journalists that busted ACORN, they do great TRUE reporting work... PLEASE no hate here in posting rhis to you. Some of us are not partisan , we just fight for TRUTH. After watching this one, please watch video 1 where the DNC directed their PACS to pay mentally ill people to cause violence at rallies. Just watch both videos, that's all, no arguing or hate filled words, just please watch both of them. And then decide how u want to vote."

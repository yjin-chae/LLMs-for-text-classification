If each person who is braging of donating money to a Millionaire were giving tools to a child to grew up and make America a rich and educated country, we would be again to be free. Feed the poor, teach the young, Take care pf the elder, your parents, the sick. Be a good citizen of the world , become an example to America."

We are not \"bragging,\" we are supporting. I give to areas I have a passion to give. I also give to help support my choice of President."

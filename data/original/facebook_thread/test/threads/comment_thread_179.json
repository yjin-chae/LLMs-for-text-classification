      "text": "And just because the corrupt Left colludes to GIVE H.R.C. yet ANOTHER PASS for an A D D I T I O N A L 650,000 secret U.S. documents (in the hand of their #2 favorite PERVERT), is N O T any reason to SURRENDER to their totally lawless Socialist oppression! Remember that she illegally hid emails in the first place IN ORDER TO feloniously EVADE F.O.I.A.! IT IS MORE REASON TO THINK FOR YOURSELF AND VOTE FOR GOVERNMENT REFORM - - Trump, for example has pissed off and called out the GOP's smaller version and will DRAIN THAT SWAMP. The Fully corrupted D.N.C (founded in 1848 on a platform of SLAVERY - - and opposed to GOP's 13th, 14th, 15th and 19th Amendments for Minorities and Womens' rights) is STUCK with the most corrupt, self-enriching, narcissistic, worst-of-the-worst of the last 40 years: Queen Hillary! Does ANYONE on this page really expect ANY reform from her?!?"

Crooked Hillary Clinton has been the mouthpiece for the corrupt Washington DC system that the MSM keeps alive through direct propaganda and support.  It is time we bring CHANGE to the White House, defeat the rigged system, and Make America Great Again!"

    "text": "I'm the only person in my family who's voting for Donald trump and I don't care. I know the truth about Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. There is enough information out there that proves how corrupt the Democratic Party really is. The American empire will fall if Hillary Clinton is elected as president. We the American people need to wake up or our country will not be a world power and a first world nation anymore. With open borders, disastrous trade deals, unaffordable health care, poverty, unemployment, illegal immigration, terrorism, debt, inflation, drug trafficking, high taxation, high cost of living, income inequality and much more our country is going to end up like Venezuela. If Hillary Clinton gets elected this country's citizens will look back and say that Donald trump was right about how horrible of a president she is because She will go down as the worse president in American history. She won't be an improvement over president Obama. She'll continue president obamas failed policies. She will not be a great president I can guarantee with absolute certainty. So I urge Hillary Clinton supporters to not complain if she's not the type of president that you hope that she'd be. Just blame yourselves for being too foolish to realize what a farce she is. She's nothing more than a Wall Street shill who's controlled by her donors, special interests, lobbyists, the establishment and Wall Street oligarchs who finance her campaign. Donald trump finances his own campaign and isn't controlled by anyone but himself. Use your common sense people. vote for someone for the right reasons and not because of what happens in their personal life."

Wikileaks revelations mean nothing to Hillary Clinton supporters. They don't care how crooked she is. Hillary Clinton supporters will still vote for Hillary Clinton no matter what just because they're democrats. Go ahead Hillary Clinton supporters vote for Hillary Clinton. If you help her get elected as president you'll be devastatingly disappointed at how much of a failure she is as president. Hillary Clinton just wants your votes and could careless about you or how this country's well being is. All Hillary Clinton wants is power and to make money. She won't make a difference as president. Her presidency will be 4 more years of obama plus corruption. Trump must win the presidency because if he doesn't win the presidency this country will go down the tubes and the American empire will fall. we'll end up being a third world country, our currency will devalue, our GDP per capital will go down, American companies will outsource their jobs to foreign companies, the 2nd amendment will be abolished, they'll have open borders, they'll be disastrous trade deals like tpp and nafta, more food stamp dependency, they'll have more handouts instead of hand ups and so much more. Get ready America our country will be doomed and it will become a giant Detroit. But somehow I believe Donald trump will win the popular vote but I'm not sure about the super delegates."

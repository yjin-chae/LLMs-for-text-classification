Crooked Hillary Clinton has been the mouthpiece for the corrupt Washington DC system that the MSM keeps alive through direct propaganda and support.  It is time we bring CHANGE to the White House, defeat the rigged system, and Make America Great Again!"

Trump is already reforming the Republicans. Whoever refuses to support Trump from the GOP will be on their way out because the voters pay attention. Meanwhile, Hillary perfectly represents the establishment, which is why so many corrupt Congresspeople from both parties support her. Their time of trampling on the American people is coming to an end."

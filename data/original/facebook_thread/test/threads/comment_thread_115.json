    "text": "I am STILL voting for Trump - I'm not interested in his vulgar language - I'm interested in strong borders - strong Military - strong economy. I want law and order - I want our Vets taken care of - I want Manufacturers to come back rebuild our inner cities get people back to work and off welfare. I'm looking for our Allies to trust us again and our enemies to fear us again - I want lower taxes for people and businesses. I want Americans to come first and be energy dependent. Hillary can provide none of that - it's that simple!"

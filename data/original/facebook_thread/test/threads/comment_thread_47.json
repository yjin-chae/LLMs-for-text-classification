    "text": "Has Hillary Clinton commented on the California Senate Bill 1146: Equity in Higher Education Act. The bill is supposed to protect the LGBT from discrimination in private religious schools that accept state grants. Of course the colleges are against the proposed bill, as the bill would end the way religious colleges operate today. The bill would not permit these private colleges from even praying before class. A student could file a complaint about a Kosher-only menu. And the college could not require the students or staff to sign statements of faith if the college accepts a student's state CalGrant."

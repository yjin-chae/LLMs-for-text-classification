Trump has made promises to the Christian extremists and evangelicals that he will appoint justices that will push anti lgbt policy and anti women's rights policy. This is not who were are! Let's move America forward into the 21st century, not back to the 20th century! Stronger TOGETHER! That includes you Trumpites, we will welcome you to our America to!"

WOMEN FOR TRUMP!"

Over a year and how many millions spent by the FBI and they got nothing. Now we find out the FBI highly favors Trump and is leading details of active cases? üòÅüòÅüòÅ"

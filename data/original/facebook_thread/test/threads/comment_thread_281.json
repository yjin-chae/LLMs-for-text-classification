      "text": "Closet voters are in your imagination, no facts to support that. I'll try to explain the facts. Trump has less support from blacks, Latinos, women and educated whites than Mitt Romney who lost to Obama. Now you say Trump will win with less numbers than Romney. To believe that repubs created an army of voters in their head and only exists in their imagination. Wow! I could have been a psychologist!"

      "text": "Agree. \"If you're under 50 you really need to read this. If you're over 50, you lived through it, so share it with those under 50. Amazing to me how much I had forgotten! When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn't even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the n taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts. Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood â€“ both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno â€“ husband Bill described her selection as \"my worst mistake.\" Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas Samantha Koresh and the Branch Samanthaian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children. Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovery of Ms. Guanier's radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration. Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and Keithiam Kelseanedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kelseanedy was forced to resign. Many younger votes will have no knowledge of \"Travelgate.\" Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson â€“ and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours. Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House. Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents. Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were: She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Kelsea Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, \"I do not recall,\" \"I have no recollection,\" and \"I don't know\" a total of 56 times while under oath. After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen. Now we are exposed to the destruction of possibly incriminating emails while Hillary was Secretary of State and the \"pay to play\" schemes of the Clinton Foundation â€“ we have no idea what shoe will fall next. But to her loyal fans (supporters) - I guess in her own words \"what difference does it make?\" I guess being a female Democrat is all that matters. By the way, I'd post the same if she were a Republican. You see, she's already been in the White House, she has a record we can review. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are in a bar. Donald leans over, and With A smile on his face, says, \"The media are really tearing you apart for That Scandal.\" Hillary: \"You mean my lying about Benghazi?\" Trump: \"No, the other one.\" Hillary: \"You mean the massive voter fraud?\" Trump: \"No, the other one.\" Hillary: \"You mean the military not getting their votes counted?\" Trump: \"No, the other one.\" Hillary: \"Using my secret private server with classified material to Hide my Activities?\" Trump: \"No, the other one.\" Hillary: \"The NSA monitoring our phone calls, emails and everything Else?\" Trump: \"No, the other one.\" Hillary: \"Using the Clinton Foundation as a cover for tax evasion, Hiring Cronies, And taking bribes from foreign countries? Trump: \"No, the other one.\" Hillary: \"You mean the drones being operated in our own country without The Benefit of the law?\" Trump: \"No, the other one.\" Hillary: \"Giving 123 Technologies $300 Million, and right afterward it Declared Bankruptcy and was sold to the Chinese?\" Trump: \"No, the other one.\" Hillary: \"You mean arming the Muslim Brotherhood and hiring them in the White House?\" Trump: \"No, the other one.\" Hillary: \"Whitewater, Watergate committee, Vince Foster, commodity Deals?\" Trump: \"No the other one:\" Hillary: \"The IRS targeting conservatives?\" Trump: \"No the other one:\" Hillary: \"Turning Libya into chaos?\" Trump: \"No the other one:\" Hillary: \"Trashing Mubarak, one of our few Muslim friends?\" Trump: \"No the other one:\" Hillary: \"Turning our backs on Israel?\" Trump: \"No the other one:\" Hillary: \"The joke Iran Nuke deal? \" Trump: \"No the other one:\" Hillary: \"Leaving Iraq in chaos? \" Trump: \"No, the other one.\" Hillary: \"The DOJ spying on the press?\" Trump: \"No, the other one.\" Hillary: \"You mean HHS Secretary Sibelius shaking down health insurance Executives?\" Trump: \"No, the other one.\" Hillary: \"Giving our cronies in SOLYNDRA $500 MILLION DOLLARS and 3 Months Later they declared bankruptcy Hillary for prison 2016 would be a good start to help make safe again.\""

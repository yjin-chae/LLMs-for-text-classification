Folks, if Hillary is elected, we will have a Constitutional crisis to live thru that will make Watergate look like childs play. During the Watergate fiasco, the OPEC countries hit us with the Oil Embargo which crippled our economy for years. Do you really want to take that chance with Hillary and our country being severely damaged??? THINK BEFORE YOU VOTE. No scare tactics here....just fact. I lived thru Watergate and our country suffered greatly. DO NOT PUT OUR COUNTRY THRU THAT AGAIN PLEASE.!!!!"

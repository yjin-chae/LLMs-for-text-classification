    "text": "With all the stress going on I'm sure some of you could use a laugh. \"Here's a joke\" Hillary Clinton goes to a gifted-student primary school in New York to talk about the world. After her talk she offers to answer questions from the kids. One little boy puts up his hand and Hillary asks him what his name is. \"Kenny,\" he says. \"And what is your question, Kenny?\" she asks. \"I have three questions,\" he says. \"First -- what happened in Benghazi? \"Second -- why would you run for president if you are not capable of handling two e-mail accounts? \"Third -- what happened to that six billion dollars that went missing while you were Secretary of State?\" Just then the bell rings for recess. Hillary tells the students that they will continue after recess. When they resume Hillary says, \"Okay, where were we? Oh, that's right, question time. Who has a question?\" A different boy -- little Johnny -- puts his hand up. Hillary points to him and asks him what his name is. \"Johnny,\" he says. \"What is your question, Johnny?\" she asks. \"I have five questions,\" he says. \"First -- what happened in Benghazi?\" \"Second -- why would you run for president if you are not capable of handling two e-mail accounts?\" \"Third -- whatever happened to that six billion dollars that went missing while you were Secretary of State?\" \"Fourth -- why did the recess bell go off 21 minutes early?\" \"And, fifth -- where's Kenny?\""

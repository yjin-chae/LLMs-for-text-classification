I believe you are the best candidate. But the baggage you are bringing is severely hampering my decision to defend you. Clear up the legal issues asap, confess to the American people what you have done (we already know you would say what you didn't do) and make this country whole."

      "text": "I add: THIS country is overrun with right wing zealots...and it was once beautiful too. They have destroyed our country, starting with protecting big business, writing laws that benefit the amazingly wealthy, running up a 'maxed out credit card' better known as the national debt. They block Supreme Court nominations that would make a deciding vote in a lock decision (the reason there is an odd number of justices). They continue to raise the debt ceiling rather than FIX the problem. The conservatives have had control of the reigns under Obama enough. They have proven their interests are not with the people but anyone with a big check book. Immigrants by definition built America. People have migrated for thousands of years. Good AND bad follow the crowd. You can not deny a world of people because ten thousand are bad."

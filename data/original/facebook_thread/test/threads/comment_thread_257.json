Hillary is the Queen of evil. A phony. A bigot."

      "text": "So you don't care that he has lied, scammed and trampled over thousands to make his money? Pandering to globalist? It's just been released that he has many foreign countries he's pandering to, look up Newsweek's report this week. We all want to safety and security, but there is no amount of money in The U.S. Treasury to pay for a wall or the manpower to enforce it or it would have already happened. He has made many promises that a President doesn't have the power to do. Congress will never approve the money for a wall or for mass deportation. Hillary has \"never\" said she wants to take away guns. She wants background checks. As for Obamacare, what's your alternative? The things he has said have been proven 74% lies. He has never held a government office, he has no experience. People say he's a successful businessman. He's been sued 3570 times so far, 2 suits for racial discrimination, 6 bankruptcies, a recent fine for an illegal donation to Pam Bondi, he's being audited by the IRS, his foundation is under investigation, and his trial begins soon in his so-called university. What do you think is the reason He won't release his taxes? Williamvery Presidential candidate for the past 40 years has done so, why should he be any different? His tax returns aren't the main issue, only one of hundreds."

      "text": "We all know the protocol by now - 1. This has nothing to do with Islam. 2. The guy was a mentally ill 'lone wolf'. 3. Those who object to points 1 and 2 are racist bigots. 4. Change Facebook profile to flag of inflicted country. 5. Light some candles, hold a vigil and go on a peace march. 6. Wait for the next slaughter to happen. 7. Repeat. For those who believe in \"White Privilege\"....take a long look at Hillary. She's the perfect example. Anyone else would be behind bars at this juncture. Happy Birthday Hillary, may this be the last birthday you enjoy as a free woman. Btw...the ONLY thing \"white privilege\" got me was a sunburn. üòè My favorite!! But it should be a regular, like the Java chip, not seasonal! And, PLWilliamASWilliam, stock up with the salt. It's called SALTed caramel. If u don't have the salt, it's not the same!! I DONT LIKWilliam STARBUCKS ANYMORWilliam AFTWilliamR THWilliam WAY THWilliamY TRWilliamATWilliamD OUR TROOPS Starbucks now offers almond milk in their drinks upon request ... my latte with almond milk was delish! I want to know about our troops do you support them or not. Love your products but if you don't support I can not support you! That's right, Rinse. Trump may have the potential to destroy this great country of ours, but he's a Republican, so you must support him. Party Before Country - unofficial GOP motto I give Kasich and Cruz credit for not endorsing the bigot and standing up for what they believe in, even though I don't agree with their politics, I respect that they Stay true to their beliefs. Trump is destroying the republican party with his divisiveness and pissing on everything they supposedly believe in. Williamvery republican who follows this guy is going to end up in the gutter while the ones with enough backbone to stand up to him will have bright political careers. If trump actually makes it into office people are going to find he isn't the saviour they thought he was going to be."

I hope you guys, take this election and soar with your new presidents dreams.. It is not only an American election but we (Australia) as many in this world will be affected by whoever takes the seat. For the sake of God and the world Trump needs to be elected and only you people can do this. Vote, vote, vote, the world is waiting for a change...."

He doesn't have to take the daily hate and criticism but he is doing it for us. I am praying that this results in a historic landslide win for Trump."

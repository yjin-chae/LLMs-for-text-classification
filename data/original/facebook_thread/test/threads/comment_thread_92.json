    "text": "Mr. Trump, It is not a sign of weakness to be quiet from time to time, but rather wise. A wise man measures his words before he speaks. You cannot afford to create more negative news, even when you lye on your back it will be negative. But we your supporters are asking you to show you are a prudent man. You are so used to fighting you don't know when to stop. We will win in November if you stop creating negative stories. Unless, you don't really want to win, then continue the road you are on. Our country is at stake and your negativity will do you in. You know you are being attacked on all sides, just let it ride off your back like a DUCK...can you do that??? Try it, and just go after Hillary and the DNC. Please get all on board, you must clean up with the women, the black votes, the hispanics., the Bernie supporters, the Independents and those from our own party,to you it may be your mode of operation but for many many people you come across very arrogant, and defensive, and lack humility. Work on this please, God Bless you..."

The target is Hillary not Ryan, or McCain, Kahn, or anyone else. The voters are becoming exhausted. Focus, Focus, Focus please Newt and your other friends are begging you to stay on message."

Crooked Hillary Clinton has been the mouthpiece for the corrupt Washington DC system that the MSM keeps alive through direct propaganda and support.  It is time we bring CHANGE to the White House, defeat the rigged system, and Make America Great Again!"

Republican elites are also going against their nominee which the people voted in with the most votes in history for that party. Go figure lol. What government goes against its own people and survives? What's going on, all elections are this way yet they abandon their nominee and people."

    "text": "I don't understand for the life of me why her supporters don't want to know the REAL TRUTH about her! The FBI would NOT HAVE reopened the investigation on her 11days before an election if they didn't have something serious! She has been involved in one scandal after another for 30 years!! Just think about it..She had those emails bleach bit for a reason!! No one does that unless there was some very criminal things on them! Hillary supporters please explain to me why you don't care that this women put our national security at risk, destroyed government property, lied to the FBI & Congress, etc.! Are you not concerned about the sovereignty and security of your country? On top of that she wants OPEN BORDERS..doesn't it concern you that ANYONE in the world could just come here?? I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD SUPPORT HER KNOWING ALL THIS?? There's a good chance that she could be indicted! WHY ON GODS GREEN EARTH WOULD YOU WANT SOMEONE UNDER FBI INVESTIGATION AS YOUR PREDIDENT?"

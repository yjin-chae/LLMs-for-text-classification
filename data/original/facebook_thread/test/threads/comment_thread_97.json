    "text": "Why are so many crying and whining over who Trump will select as VP? For God's sake The VP the majority of the time is nothing more than a \"go between\", between the President, and Congress. It's who Mr. Trump selects for other positions that will have a greater affect on the future, than who he selects as VP. The Secretary of State, The Attorney General. The Secretary of Defense, A new Director of the CIA as the present director will resign. Supreme Court Justices, and Trumps chief of staff, and chief advisors,.. and the other nearly 3000 positions a President fills during his term., including judge appointments all across the Nation will determine the future. I expect Newt will be Trumps chief advisor. All of the different factions within the Republican party need to wake up, and face reality. The GOP is not a solely far right wing party, and never has been. Matter of fact they have always been more moderates in the party, than far right conservatives. Mr. Ronald Reagan was a good example. He represented the moderates and conservatives, always depending on the issues. Those who think Mr. Reagan was a far right conservative need to go back and research history. He represented ALL Americans. This election is a battle between the far left Liberal Socialists, and the rest of the Country. it's that simple."

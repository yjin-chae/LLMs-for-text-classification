      "text": "Ethan No one treated Bernie any differently than any other potentially destructive person within the party. IMO he stood zero chance of being elected and was stubborn about refusing to become part of the Democratic organization. Debbie Wasserman Schultz did the correct thing in exploring his weaknesses. Bernie was a loose cannon. Lately, Bernie is acting as a responsible politician so I am hoping that this conflict with him is completely over. As reported, Donna Brazile leaked one hint about one question, which was the most obvious issue of Flint MI, not much there. During my career I was paid well because I was great at dealing with unpleasant realities within corporations. Not a fantasy artist here. BTW Wikileaks emails were provided by the GRU, the modern KGB, hope you think it good for the U.S. to use them as a source. Finally, I was comparing Hillary's behavior vs. the right wing Republicans, for example the right wingers who are perverting the FBI and destroying the FBI's ability to perform a police function. The FBI does not have a court function to declare guilt, such as 'she was extremely careless'. That and Comey's note to Congress are eroding the rule of law."

Why was it necessary to feed Hillary the debate questions and not Bernie? Bernie never had a chance and does give trump legitimate cause to say the election is rigged"

      "text": "Ethan I did some more research on Snopes about the DNC and Bernie. You are correct in that they did try to sabotage him. My guess is that the far left direction to which he was pulling the Dem platform was a death knell for any chance of victory. This country, except for the young voters, is now quite conservative relative to a few decades ago. IMO Bernie and his positions could never win on his own, the country as a whole would not now elect a far left liberal under almost any circumstances. Also, IMO Bernie started out with no inclination to work within an organization. He is terribly intelligent but as with many super intelligent people he is so stuck on himself he doesn't understand when some other people are in fact smarter than him. If the DNC had not blocked Bernie and worked with him to integrate him into the Dem Party he would have done immense damage to the U.S. However, all said and done, I agree that the Dems should NOT have done anything to rig the primary election against Bernie."

They will blame it on the media, the speechwriter (she said she wrote it herself) the Pink Panther, the Tooth Fairy...anyone else...but won't apologize or accept responsibility because that's how he rolls. Con artist."

      "text": "No apology ever. Deflect, attack, lie, evade, don't answer simple questions. Trump and his campaign operate exactly like Scientologists: Attack, sue, defame, lie...etc. Why not admit and explain how the mistake (plagiarism) happened and apologize. People generally forgive and forget when you apologize and they move on. When you never apologize, make it a policy not to apologize, then there is a fundamental problem. An honesty problem."

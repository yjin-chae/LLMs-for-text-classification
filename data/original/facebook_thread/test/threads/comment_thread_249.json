    "text": "We're 5 days from the election, and to be honest I'm really tired. I think we all are. It's up to everyone to make their own choices as to who they decide should run this country. However, the mere fact that Trump is a nominee to be our President, and is as close as he is, makes me despise my own country, and my fellow countrymen. That is insane. I love the USA, I've been honored to grow up here, to have the privileges I've been given, to have others brave enough to fight on our behalf. We are a nation of many peoples and nationalities, of races and colors, of religious and nonreligious. We are a nation that eradicated slavery, invented technologies unimagined, ended the rule of a brutal demagogue, and rebuilt the world in his disastrous wake. We are that country, and somehow, many years later, we are within 2% points of electing one of our own. I hate when people call Trump \"Hitler,\" he's not. He's just an idiot who got himself way too far into something he likely had no idea would lead him to this position. I also hate when people call Trump Supporters \"morons\" or \"uninformed\" or \"uneducated\" or whatever else it might be. They're not! They're simply screaming out for help, having no idea where to turn. We're the ones who put Trump on the pedestal, though. He has divided our country in ways I cannot have imagined, and likely has destroyed any chances of our peoples uniting in a meaningful way at any time in the near future. He has humiliated our friends, our loved ones, and yet we continue to see him as an answer to our problems. Our problems are our own, but a single man cannot correct them...only we can. Progress does not come in bursts, it comes with calculation and planning, wisdom and intellect, education and experience. Trump has neither the attribute or desires of promotion of intellectualism. Trump is a danger to this country in ways so profound, that I can't fault people for not understanding why that is. Our fellow citizens need help, but he is not the answer to their problems. Despite all of her faults, Clinton is the only one that can properly steer this country. Listen to the people that have dedicated their lives to their fields of economics, military, government, foreign policy. These people by YUGE majorities recognize the potential of calamitous damage by the hands of Trump. To my friends, who may be Republican, or other friends simply withholding their vote, I implore you...four years of Clinton is four years of stability. You'll have your chance to remove her, but now is not the time. Putting our country in the hands of a person who has no conceptualization of how to run a government, and how to adhere to international principles of cordiality is a person who can undue the hundreds of years our forefathers have put into creating this incredible place. I have faith that we are better than this, I have faith this is not the America we will become. I hope my fellow citizens prove me right. If not, then those of us fighting for good had better be ready to step up to the plate to keep him from ruining this country. Not with arms, but with the pen, and our voices. #voteclinton"

      "text": "progress doesn't come in burst, Lydia, but large scale structural changes can occur within just a few short years. I am from India, and we here are undergoing structural change of massive proportions, and these changes began after our current prime minister Mr Modi rose to power less than three years ago. i cannot describe every initiative that the current leadership has taken, that will go into very many pages, but do google it, you will surely be inspired. we were struggling with status quo, litigations, miserable corruption, high inefficiencies, no vision and zero innovation for a decade, and then... new vigour, new life, new vision, new zeal, new pride. it happens, man."

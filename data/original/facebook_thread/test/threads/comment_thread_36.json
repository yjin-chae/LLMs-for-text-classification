    "text": "BREAKING NEWS: Hillary Clinton questioned by FBI National Security & Espionage Division On Saturday, July 2nd, 2016, Hillary Clinton was forced to submit to questioning by top FBI criminal investigators. I guess it's not a, \"Security Review\" anymore, is it, Hillary? On Friday, July 1st, Hillary Clinton was given an ultmatum by the FBI; either submit to questioning, or be subpoenaed, and arrested should she fail to show. Make no mistake... this is a high level felony criminal investigation into the wanton and reckless mishandling of top secret government documents, and potential charges of espionage for allowing staff members with no security clearance to have access to those restricted materials. It is also a felony to transmit or store classified materials on an unauthorized non government network or server. Hillary Clinton apparently did this on at least 34 separate occasions. Anyone else would already have been arrested and be behind bars, but Obama's corrupt Department of Justice has been obstructing justice and stalling the investigation, in hopes that Hillary Clinton might be able to run for President. Hillary Clinton will lie and tell you that she volunteered to be questioned. Uh, no. No one volunteers to be questioned for three and a half hours by the FBI! It's over, Hillary. You're done. by #Jacob"

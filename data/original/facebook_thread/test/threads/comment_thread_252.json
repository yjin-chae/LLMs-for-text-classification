You are voting against democracy. You are saying our votes don't matter and that's ok. You are saying it's ok to cheat we will reward you for it. Good job America you are ensuring there will be more rigged elections."

Why would they stop when the people do nothing about it? And when a republican does it the other side will cry. Why do we put our morals aside to back a criminal and a cheater? Dem for life right or wrong? Is that the deal? Btw I didn't vote for bush I am not a republican or a democrat. I'm an American who is tired of corrupt politicians"

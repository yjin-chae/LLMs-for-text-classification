They picked a candidate and it quickly became about their own egos. To them, Bernie's opinion doesn't matter now. They are freaked out because they can't \"win\". It isn't about Hillary or Bernie. It is about them now. It is sad, but true."

My comment has to do with how some of his supporters are turning on him now because he has made this decision. If they are so supportive, why are they turning against him now? It is because their support wasn't grounded in conviction. BTW I have always been a Bernie supporter, but I have to go with this flow because I am not stupid. Being stubborn or wanting to be a martyr for the cause will not help our country now. If Trump gets elected, we might not have a country anymore. I think you might be the one who is confused. Check yourself."

    "text": "Haha! A personal insult if Black Americans don't vote for Hillary? Wow!!!! You, Mr. Obama, have insulted our way of life, education, budget, military, Christian values, safety, peace, integrity in the world, and most importantly the vast majority of Americans who voted for you. And, now your standing mighty on the pulpit demanding people vote for Hillary? What have you done to make race relations better? What have you done to give hope and change to the inner cities of Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Atlanta and the list goes on and on. What have you done to ensure our vets get the care they deserve or our kids get the education YOU promised. Nothing! I'm insulted at the thought that we should continue down this bridge to nowhere by voting for Hillary! Fool us once shame on you! Fool us twice shame on us! Not gonna happen a 3rd time."

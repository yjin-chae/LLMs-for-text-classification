    "text": "Trump's followers have elected a misogynistic and xenophobic racist as their leader, but there are other issues, and they should matter to everyone. Why aren't the following questions discussed, dispelled or verified? Trumps tax returns would clarify, but as Trump Jr. said: \"That would detract from my dad's message\". Really?! You may copy/paste/share these questions if you want answers. 1. How will you handle your organization's non-cancelable contractual obligations with parties whose interests conflict with those of the United States? 2. While refusing to release your tax returns, how will you confirm that you do not have dangerous financial ties to bad actors abroad? 3. If you were willing to work with Qaddafi—a known terrorist and dictator—is there anyone you aren't willing to make a deal with? Who? 4. How can you be tough on Iran, given your business partnership with someone connected to Iranian money laundering? 5. Given that you've already questioned our commitments to NATO allies, how would you handle the millions of dollars flowing into your organization from your Istanbul and other international properties. 6. To what extent would your foreign policy be dictated by potential financial benefits for your business partners? 7. Will you disclose the nature of your personal and business relationships with all of the Russian oligarchs you are \"close\" to or might owe money to? 8. Have you or your campaign discussed U.S.-Russian relations with the Russian billionaires with whom you've done business? 9. How did the Russian mob boss who ran a criminal organization out of Trump Tower get a VIP pass to your Miss Universe pageant in Moscow? 10. With business ties to politically-connected Indian developers, how can you conduct foreign policy that puts the U.S. above your profits? 11. How can we be sure you'd be willing to be tough on any nation if necessary, if it would put your interests and profits at risk? 12. How can we know you won't (again) impulsively damage relationships with crucial allies to preserve your own ego? 13. We know you engaged extensively in pay-to-play here at home. Have you bribed foreign officials or other parties abroad? 14. To what extent are you and your family currently contractually tied to payments from foreign business partners, or governments? 15. You've mentioned 120 foreign deals, including in countries with national security implications. Where and with whom are you working? 16. Will your children disclose all of the foreign trips and business deals they've undertaken during the campaign, and with whom they met? 17.In sum, how will you guarantee that if forced to choose between America's security and your own bank account, you won't pick the latter? 18. It's pretty clear you've spent your life unscrupulously looking out for your own wallet above all. Why would that change if you're president? 19. If elected, will you and your family sever ties to the Trump organization? 20. Do you, or have you ever had willful connections with criminal elements?"

Where are the 30,000+ emails that she had deleted? Why she use bleach on them so God could even see him? Why did she lie to the American people about the private server she had when secretary of state? Her Failed policies helped the rise of radical Islamic terrorism we're dealing with today. You ever heard of the JV team?"

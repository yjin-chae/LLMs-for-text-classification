Only Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics. Only Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would of simply told the truth in the first place ! Only Hillary Clinton regularly cussed out and belittled her Secret Service detail. But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump ? That is insane ! If you can read this and still vote for Hillary you are whats wrong with America........... . John Brennan, current head of the CIA converted to Islam while stationed in Saudi Arabia. Obama's top adviser, Valerie Jarrett, is a Muslim who was born in Iran where her parents still live. Hillary Clinton's top adviser, Huma Abedin is a Muslim, whose mother and brother are involved in the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Assistant Secretary for Policy Development for Homeland Security, Arif Aikhan, is a Muslim. Homeland Security Adviser, Mohammed Elibiary, is a Muslim. Obama adviser and founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Salam al-Marayati, is a Muslim.. Obama's Sharia Czar, Imam Mohamed Magid, of the Islamic Society of North America is a Muslim.. Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships, Eboo Patel, is a Muslim. 1/13/15:?? Nancy Pelosi announced she will appoint Rep Andre Carson,> D-Ind, as the first Muslim lawmaker on the House of Representatives> Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. It would make Carson the first Muslim to serve on the committee that receives intelligence on> the threat of Islamic militants in the Middle East! He has suggested that U.S. schools should be modeled after Islamic madrassas, where education is based on the Quran!!! And last but not least, our closet Muslim himself, Barack Hussein Obama. It's questionable if Obama ever officially took the oath of office when he was sworn in. He didn't repeat the oath properly to defend our nation and our Constitution. Later the Democrats claimed he was given the oath again in private. Like · Reply · 2 hrs ABC News executive producer Ian Cameron is married to Susan Rice, Obama's National Security Adviser.2) CBS President David Rhodes is the brother of Ben Rhodes, Obama's Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications.3) ABC News correspondent Claire Shipman is married to former Obama Whitehouse Press Secretary Jay Carney.4) ABC News and Univision reporter Matthew Jaffe is married to Katie Hogan, Obama's Deputy Press Secretary.5) ABC President Ben Sherwood is the brother of Obama's Special Adviser Elizabeth Sherwood.6) CNN President Virginia Moseley is married to former Hillary Clinton's Deputy Secretary Tom Nides.Etc... etc... Get the picture? the teachings of Saul Alinsky a communist socialist died about 43 years ago, but his writings have influenced the politicians who control our nation today. Hillary Clinton did a college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama writes about him in his books. Rules for Liberal Radicals Anyone think this stuff isn't happening today in the U.S. ? All eight rules are currently in play. There are eight levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a Liberal Socialist state. The first is the most important. 1) Healthcare: Control healthcare and you control the people. DONE. 2) Poverty: Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live. DONE. 3) Debt: Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty. DONE. 4) Gun Control: Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state. WORKING ON IT. 5) Welfare: Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income). DONE. 6) Education: Take control of what people read and listen to. Take control of what children learn in school. DONE. 7) Religion: Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools. DONE. 8) Class Warfare: Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor. DONE. Any of this sound like what is happening to the United States? Alinsky simplified Vladimir Lenin's original scheme for world conquest by communism, under Russian rule. Stalin described his converts as \"Useful Idiots.\" The \"Useful\" Liberal Idiots have destroyed every nation in which they have seized power and control. It's presently happening at an alarming rate in the U.S. If people can read this and still say everything is just fine. They're the useful idiots. \"It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere.\" Wake Up America! Hillary Clinton a liberal Socialist is running for office! She is backed by George Soros a Communist Socialist who backs and controls the Devout Muslim, \"Barack Hussein Obama Channel 12 in Beaumont Texas did the reporting . According to the Beaumont newspaper and reports from a couple of Beaumont TV stations this really happened. Why did Hillary REALLY visit Beaumont, Texas - Got to read this!! Hillary Clinton made a campaign stop yesterday in Beaumont, Texas. Only six people were there to greet her. Her security detail outnumbered her supporters by quite a bit. She wouldn't talk, wave to or even acknowledge those there to greet her. So bad as that is, it's not the real story here. The real story is who she took a private meeting with. After landing, Clinton headed off to a fundraiser in West Beaumont, where she was greeted by around 150-200 Muslims, most of whom were of Pakistani origin. The event was held by Pakistani businessman Tahir Javed and Hillary raised approximately $500,000 by pandering to Muslims, making it \"one of the top five private fundraiser's Clinton has had in this country.\" She's bought and paid for by them. Spread this far and wide."

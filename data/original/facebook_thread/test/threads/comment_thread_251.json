AMERICA HAS BECOME THE ONLY COUNTRY WHERE STUDENTS TAKE ON LOANS THEY CAN NEVER ESCAPE, NOT EVEN BY DECLARING BANKRUPTCY. STUCK IN THIS BROKEN SYSTEM, MILLENNIALS ARE THE FIRST GENERATION THAT EXPECT THEIR OWN LIVES TO BE WORSE THAN THE LIVES OF THEIR PARENTS. WHILE AMERICAN FAMILY EXPENSES HAVE BEEN INCREASING RELENTLESSLY, THEIR INCOMES HAVE BEEN STAGNANT. IN REAL DOLLARS, IMMEDIATE HOUSEHOLD MAKES LESS MONEY TODAY THAT MADE 17 YEARS AGO. NEARLY HALF OF AMERICANS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH $400 IF THEY NEEDED IT FOR AN EMERGENCY.PETER THIEL üá∫üá∏VOTE TRUMP"

That is why Trump is here we are tired of the corrupt career politicians, it's not about Republican or Democrat it's about change. Sick of the same old thing. At least half of America is trying to do something about our corrupt system. We can't keep electing the same corrupt career politicians and expect some great change, that doesn't make good sense. That goes for the House and Senate also.We should have term limits on all politicians. Time to move into 21st century politics, No more dynasties"

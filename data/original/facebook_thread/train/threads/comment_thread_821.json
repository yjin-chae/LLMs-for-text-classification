The only way to battle evil is with good. We must compassionately educate, counsel with and support those who cannot span the gap on their own. Let's take our country back from these jesters."

He even endangered his great nephew's life for his greed. Who are you kidding? Another ignorant person for Trump! Quit parroting everyone else and do some actual research!"

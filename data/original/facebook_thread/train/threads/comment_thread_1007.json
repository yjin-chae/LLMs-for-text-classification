    "text": "I do support you. While your language was x rated...that was 11 years ago. You are a Christian now and I do expect your behavior to be above board. God is your boss. May I suggest that you get back with some seasoned Christians on a regular basis. Romans 8:28 I do believe that all things work together for good for those that love God and are called according to His Purpose. I believe you have been called."

In an interview with columnist Cal Thomas earlier this year, Trump said he would ask for forgiveness. \"I will be asking for forgiveness, but hopefully I won't have to be asking for much forgiveness,\" he said."

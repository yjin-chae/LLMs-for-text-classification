Hillarys always boasting about accountability, but never apologized to Bernie Sanders for the injustice done to him by the DNC during the primary race...Schultz was fired, but Hillary rehired her and Bernie pretended to be angry, but then endorsed Hillary? Talking about screwed up? You would have thought the mainstream media would have had that news on everyday till Election Day...and Bernie supports are going to vote for her, really?"

This plan is reminiscent of your other failed business ventures, only now we are playing with governments rather than strictly corporations or entrepreneurs. Voting #JohnsonWeld."

The copays are ridiculous! The middle class are given huge penalties if they can't pay their premiums. Their necessities like electricity, water, housing, food Ect. Should be above healthcare. It's not affordable! Hillary will be worse than Obama. Not only will she raise middle class taxes, she'll raise Obamacare and destroy America. Hillary could not even create jobs in NY. She want even acknowledge that Americans are suffering. Americans want to be put first. Trump will not ignore the cries of the American people. We need change!"

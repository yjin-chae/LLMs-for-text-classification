    "text": "Donald Trump is running the most divisive campaign of our lifetimes. His message is that you should be afraid of people whose ethnicity is different, or whose religious faith is different, or who were born in a different country. There's no innuendo or dog-whistles anymore. It's all out in the open now.\n\nSo we've got to come back twice as strong and twice as clear. We've got to say with one voice that Latinos are a vital part of the American community."

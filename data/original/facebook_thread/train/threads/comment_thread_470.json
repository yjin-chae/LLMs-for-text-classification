Where are any records that trump has done anything... just quite weird)... so yeah, go ahead and support a criminal."

One does not pay taxes, abuses females...other sending e-mails and married to a strange former ex president...I do not support any of both but I am concerned that one of both has power to press a red button...! As I am not US I can not vote nor support..."

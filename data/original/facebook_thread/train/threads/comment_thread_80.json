Imagine him having a disagreement with 'Putin', for example with all they have at their disposal?! Would you trust Trump to bite his tongue gather his thoughts and say and do the right thing? Not a chance he is incapable of being diplomatic, of being level headed. He seems to be on the biggest ego trip of all time. VOTE HILLARY."

      "text": "SHE BELONGS IN JAIL.........For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:\"(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term \"office\" does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.\" Yes, it explicitly states \"shall forfeit his/her office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.\" So, yes, it really is that simple. Hillary is \"disqualified from holding any office under the United States.\" So the only question left really should be to Mr. Trey Gowdy, who in our government is not afraid of her and going to step-up and follow the rule of the law and secondly, who is going to replace her on the Democratic ticket? Let's see in the upcoming days how many of those \"tough talking\" politicians will finally back up what they've been saying to the American people all this time and put Hillary Clinton in jail."

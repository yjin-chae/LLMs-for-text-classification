    "text": "As an Independent on the fence, I thought Melania delivered a very well spoken and powerful speech, shifting my lean towards Trump...that is until I saw her side by side speech comparison with the current first ladies 2008 Democratic speech. Totally plagiarized. I'm not saying I'm now voting for Hillary, but this is a big blow to the Trump campaign. Not only did she plagiarize from Michelle almost verbatim but Michelle's speech writer was also Hillary's ex speech writer. Turns out Donalds only highlight from the first day of the convention turns out to be the most embarrassing. Hopefully he'll be able to shake this off."

This is just too bad for Melania as I'm sure she had no knowledge of this plagiarism from her writers. Her only mistake was in trying to take credit for writing her own speech in an interview with Matt Lauer just moments before she actually gave the speech. Poor lady I hope she can shake it off. I'm not worried about Donald, he'll shake it off as it never happened."

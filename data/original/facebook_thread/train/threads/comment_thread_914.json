It's about when nobody's watching and you're alone or in a small group of people and you're making really tough decisions, do you have somebody who's steady? Do you have somebody who has done their homework? It's got to be somebody who recognizes that we all have a part to play, and that's something I'm absolutely convinced Hillary Clinton can do.\" —President Obama"

I rather they do that, then what Trump does. He willingly does business with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Dubai and UAE. Trump willingly does personal business with Muslim countries then makes racist comments about Muslims. He's a hypocrite."

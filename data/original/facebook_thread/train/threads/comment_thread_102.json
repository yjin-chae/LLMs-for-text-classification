      "text": "Why do we believe Trump's taxes are being audited? Because he's told us so? He could be lying. Because his attorneys have said so? They could be lying. There is a document Trump could release to prove his taxes are being audited beyond any doubt. It is a letter titled \"Notice of Audit\" from the IRS. Every person or business being audited gets one. The Notice doesn't reveal anything personal. The Notice doesn't reveal any part of the tax return in question. It simply announces an audit. We should demand Trump release his a \"Notice of Audit\" for every year he refuses to show us, and if he does not we should demand he stops claiming he can't release his income tax returns because of IRS audits. It's that simple."

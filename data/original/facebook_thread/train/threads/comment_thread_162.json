Now that the investigations have been reopened, it is important that the voters understood that the sole POSSIBILITY that the USA might find itself without a President, to be replaced by its VP in case she is judged guilty, IS A RISK AMERICA CANNOT TAKE. It would destroy its stability AND CREDIBILITY in the global scenario."

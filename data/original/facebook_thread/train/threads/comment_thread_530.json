How could you have allowed them to die in this attack?\""

They lost men some of their Rangers; they could not save those in trouble ; they have lost their jobs, security clearance , benefits, pensions , insurance etc. Also are ya aware that never a US plane to rescue these folks was sent; never! These Rangers had to negotiate on their own with a Lebanese pilot to take them to Germany where they saw to the medical needs of the injured, were fed & were allowed to rest...... But never was a US Plane deployed to come save them!"

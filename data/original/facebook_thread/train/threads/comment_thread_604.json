    "text": "Donald J. Trump!!! I am wanting to speak to you! The only thing, I fear, that you can do to win and get us out of this mess is to have a MEETING WITH THE REPUBLICANS ( Ryan and friends) and pray, pray, pray. that they will see you are our hope unless he wants to get in there and doing it himself and he is becoming more disgusting every day. I admired him and am getting more disgusted by the second. Tell me how to get a message or conversation with you. It is not my way to feel as though I am \"begging\" either for someone to accept me because I am who I am. However it is time to get over ourselves and get the GOP back if possible. I will go down with you because with out your win, we have lost our future anyway, Not words, Fact!"

      "text": "Hey did you just really say that? That's absolutely amazing it's the same thing that I was thinking thank you for telling me that Thank you for all the information I was really inspirational and I really enjoyed it and I'm going to take these thoughts and move for with my day To prove his own existence, Trump hungers for endless attention from outside. Lacking internal measures of his own worth, he relies on external but insecure criteria like wealth, beauty, fame and others' attention. The bacon is never that long and the cheese melts on the meat you can't even see it. Oh I'm still getting this for dinner üçîüçü Theres no such thing as too much Bacon ???? the headline should read, Theres no such thing as items we advertise on TV !!! Mom saw this on tv , she wanted it so i went , they said they dont have it yet, I said to the young girl taking my order for it , Do you have buns? she said yes, I said do you have cheese ? she said Yes, i said do you have bacon ? she said yes , i said do you have meat ? she said not for that burger , I said HUH ? smh Omg this is the Bacon Double Cheese Burger they used to sell! They still sell bacon double cheese burgers but it doesn't look like it used to be pre 2009 Despite phone messages, emails and comments on your page about being overcharged, treated rudely, and refused a refund by an employee who said i would have to return on another day, and make my complaint with a manager to get any money back for the items i did not order, i have not heard a response back. I guess BK no longer cares about their customers, or in this case, now former customers Hopefully it is the size of a Regular Burger or Bigger, One time I ordered something that looked good on a picture and it turned out to be a Biscuit Sized Burger at a high price. Fingers Crossed that it is not a Tiny Burger , But a Big Burger. I went to bk yesterday and after seeing multiple commercials for the bacon king I was super excited to try one, the lady taking my order sounded like she had no idea what I was talking about and that they don't have such a burger, I ended up getting the a1 burger and for $6 it was not worth it it was cold, and not very good, I am sketchy going there because it seems every time I do the burgers are cold... Not very happy"

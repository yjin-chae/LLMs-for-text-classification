Living with a wife cheating president while in office. I hope when I wake up my new t-shirt will read hillary in prison 2016....."

      "text": "Andrew - What's a good ole Italian guy from NY posting a complete lie about Mrs. Clinton being responsible for 4 deaths? You need to say 3 Hail Marys' and 4 Our Fathers next Sunday before you receive communion. And here's why Andrew: Just to set the record straight and for all those people who post about Benghazi, let me just say... Mrs. Clinton or anyone else could not have saved those poor unfortunate 4 Americans who died in Benghazi. And that does NOT come from me as an opinion, but from the lips of Trey Gowdy, Republican Chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. Approximately 3 weeks ago in an interview on Fox Noise he said (and l'm paraphrasing) No one could have saved those men because All the American Troops that were in the proximity of Benghazi were stationed to far away and could NOT have reached them in time to save their lives. Furthermore, he added that his committee could find No evidence of a \"STAND DOWN\" order. Just like the 7 other committees that have investigated this issue, prior to his committee. Let me also Add this for all those that don't know and still want to blame her as Head of the State Department at the time, the stationing of All American Troops world-wide is a Function and Responsibility of the Defense Department NOT the State Department. Mr. Gowdy ended the interview by saying the State Department and Defense Department are not blameless in this incident and his final report will point out the many things that should have been done and could be done in the future to insure an incident like this isn't repeated. So Andrewe, since you are like all the other conspiracy theorists out there let me ask you this: Don't you think if there were some damning evidence that his committee had uncovered against Mrs. Clinton or anyone else being responsible for these 4 deaths in Benghazi, that they would have produced that evidence by now? Especially since his Committee is, to put it gently, not so unbiased. Answer that question Andrewe and do it Logically. So Andrewe you can Hate Mrs. Clinton for all sorts of reasons and don't vote for her if you must, but to keep following and posting this misguided and utterly false premise that she is somehow responsible for the deaths of these Americans is WRONG; Totally and Utterly WRONG. And it does an injustice to not only her but to all those tireless employees who served and are still serving in some of the most dangerous places around the world. So Andrewe do your penance this Sunday before Communion. I don't want to see a fellow Italian and NYer have any bad luck in the future. ðŸ˜±ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”"

If you're with Hillary, donate now: hrc.io/2ec2HcJ\n\n\"As of this morning, the Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll has us down one point. As of yesterday, Trump's odds of winning had climbed to above 1-in-4, per Nate Silver's projections. And he seems to be making up ground in Florida, according to a whole slew of polls. The truth is that Trump has a real, viable path to 270 electoral votes.\n\nWe have a very small window of time left to try to deploy resources to our battleground states that it will take to guarantee a win. So I'm asking you: Can you be one of the people we need on Facebook to step up and chip in to our GOTV Fund today to try to make sure we prove this poll an outlier come Tuesday?\n\nThis is the most consequential election in our lifetimes. Even a dollar today shows that you're fighting for Hillary: hrc.io/2ec2HcJ\n\nThanks,\nRobby\""

A voting for Killarry means you casting your vote for murdering babies and accepted her criminal behaviors, don't you read anything else besides liberal media. Do your homework. By the way last year over 800,000 aborted babies. Killarry and Bill have open marriages. If anyone did any criminal act is the clinton. Obama knew about Hillary private emails because he is using his pseudo name sending correspondence. Check WikiLeaks. Don't be too shallow. Our country are facing moral and economic decay. Open your eyes and think objectively . I like strong women but not at the expense of immoral and deceptive behavior. Killarry craves for power and willing to sell America for herself. You, Killarry voters, are on the wrong side. Mark 8:36King James Version (KJV) 36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"

    "text": "Hillary, you helped my child many years ago when Bill was running for his second term. She had a mock election at her school (same one that Tyler went to) and she was the only one who voted for Bill. She was harassed and mocked by you little classmates for voting for a \"baby Killer\". You were at Camp David with your family. Molly called me to get Tyler's homework and I told her what had happened and how upset my daughter was. You got my daughter (not me) on the phone and told her how important it was to stick by your guns when you know you are right - no matter what -- but never to be afraid of changing when you learn something new. That was a total \"MOM thing between you and me\" but it changed my daughter's life (although at the time she just thought you were Molly's sister). Show them THAT side of my Hillary!"

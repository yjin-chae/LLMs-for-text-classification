    "text": "On Friday, FBI Director James Comey bowed to partisan pressure and released a vague and inappropriate letter to Congress that only serves to give Republicans a new line of attack against Hillary. Here's what we've learned from news reports: The emails may not have been to or from Hillary. The emails weren't even ever on her server. The FBI case has not been re-opened.\n\nHFA Press Secretary Brian Fallon breaks it down."

The investigators saw enough of the emails to determine that they appeared pertinent to the previously completed investigation and that they may be emails not previously reviewed. Because they don't have a warrant specific to Abedin's emails, officials have not been able to further examine them. Justice Department and FBI officials view Abedin as cooperative with the investigation."

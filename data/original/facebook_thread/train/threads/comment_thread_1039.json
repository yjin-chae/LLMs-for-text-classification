      "text": "Not out of context! Trump said it! It would be out of context if adding \"nukes\" to it! This comment comes from a 90-minute speech in Iowa on Nov. 12, 2015. In the speech, Trump theorized that former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein feigned having weapons of mass destruction to scare neighboring Iran, before briefly sidetracking into his feelings on war generally. \"This is the Trump theory on war,\" he said. \"But I'm good at war. I've had a lot of wars of my own. I'm really good at war. I love war in a certain way. But only when we win.\""

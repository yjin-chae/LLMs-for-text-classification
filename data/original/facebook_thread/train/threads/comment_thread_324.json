    "text": "If Hillary Clinton is elected, it means: 1. Globalism, not American Exceptionalism 2. Needs of corporations come first, not the people 3. Absolute sanctity of human life is rejected 4. Religion subject to the judgement of secular social engineering 5. Government will make its own rules as it goes along, and decide what information we get It's a high price to pay, just to tell a billionaire that we don't like his style. We HAVE the proof that Clinton is an existential threat to our Democracy. God has given us the power to save this amazing country, all we have to do is go vote."

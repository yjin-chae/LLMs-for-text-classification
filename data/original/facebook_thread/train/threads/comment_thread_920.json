      "text": "When I was a kid in Californiat, we had a 9pm curfew. The helicopters would come through the streets at 8:45 telling us we had 15 minutes to be in from of our homes. At about 9-9:15pm the police cars would pass to check that we lived there. They use to be really strict. I see a serious lack of security since a child. You would get stopped a second time driving back to Californiat from TJ. They would check your car to make sure you didn't sneak anybody out. Now as an adult, they were no longer doing that. It was quick to get bank home."

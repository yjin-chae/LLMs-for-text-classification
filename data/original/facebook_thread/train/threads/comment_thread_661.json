    "text": "I am beyond thrilled to see SO MANY intelligent people of color recognizing how Trump WILL enrich their lives with opportunity (me too) as he brings great opportunity back to the USA. Obama's life is super enriched now from the help of tons of black voters who supported him and clearly their lives have NOT been likewise enriched, or even a little bit. I welcome you ALL and can't help but feel excited and look forward to a decent paycheck again like I used to have before Washington jerks chased all the jobs overseas. Their goal was to advance their own 'Make them lean on gov't' to control them' agendas. Welcome, welcome, welcome everyone."

      "text": "The Brian Williams Press and Clinton running from Sniper Fire and a video should be all Americans hear, unfortunately close to half of the country is under some form of Government entitlement.Welfare unemployment or disability. Health Care , Property Taxes, Irs Tax, and sales tax takes almost half of our income. Our Ballots are printed in Spanish when Immigrants should know English, it is the official language. This is discrimination against all other Americans that speak other languages. I can not go to another Country and vote in an election without proving who I am and demand it be printed in English. Black people are being hurt severely by illegal immigration and welfare, The democratic Party has them in Chains."

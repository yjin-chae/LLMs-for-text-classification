    "text": "Putin is a cut throat, dictator with no ethics and will use all necessary means to quell dissent while also using clever methods to propagate his PR ( See the RT channel). However abhorrent, Putin is, he does have a high IQ and is pretty intelligent, speaks measuredly and has cultivated his tough guy image through action. Trump, on the other hand is just a Chump, born with a silver spoon. End of story!!!"

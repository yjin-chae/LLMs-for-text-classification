    "text": "On Friday, FBI Director James Comey bowed to partisan pressure and released a vague and inappropriate letter to Congress that only serves to give Republicans a new line of attack against Hillary. Here's what we've learned from news reports: The emails may not have been to or from Hillary. The emails weren't even ever on her server. The FBI case has not been re-opened.\n\nHFA Press Secretary Brian Fallon breaks it down."

Ask them to report on Trump's upcoming trials & not just what they *think* Hilary has done, talk about what Trump has actually done !! The media helps Trump by not talking about his upcoming trials, if he goes to jail how would he be President anyway ! How can anyone make a big deal over some stupid emails when Trump has engaged in rape & fraud ! Hilary didn't rape anyone & Bill Clinton is NOT running for President , how many people don't get that yet. Yes it makes a difference !! Use your brain & think -- Hate to break the news to you !! Trump goes much further than so-called \"locker room talk\". There is no slander, do some research, learn something !!!! **************** Trump University & rape of 13 year old, one trial is scheduled for November 28 and the other for December 13th ! trump supporters are sooo stupid ! Believe anything he tells you rather than research for yourself ðŸ˜‚ *************** (CNN) - New York's attorney general, who is leading a lawsuit against Trump University there, made his view of the case clear on Thursday: \"It's fraud. This is straight up fraud.\" ****************** rawstory - 2016 trump-to-head-to-court-in-december-for-tying-up-and-raping-a-13-year-old-girl-"

Whether we are white, black, brown, yellow, or red, we are tired of living in Hillary's sewer. We will all continue to be sorrowfully blue if we continue to be blue..... Let's do something about it come election day."

When Trump said that \"He knows more about Isis than the Generals Do \" I can't imagine having Donald Trump in the White House he is like a nightmare for USA and the entirely world.😵😵😵😵😵 Hillary for President 2016!!!👍👍👍"

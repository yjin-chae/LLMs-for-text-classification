      "text": "I really believe that if she could have it her way, every American head would be on a silver platter in a trophy case in her glorious hall of shame as she sits and gloats about all the dishonorable lies, deaths of our American soldiers, and money and lives she has stolen more and more. She talks about making people accountable.. How about she start with herself! Ever notice how her clothing style ALONE makes a very profound statement? She dresses like Dr Evil from Wayne's World and also like Communist Chairman Mao! I wouldn't be one bit surprised if she stole some of his clothing and has it dyed several colors as a deception and cover up tool for another classic Hillary Rodham Clinton lie of 'I didn't steal THAT, it was a gift!' We need to start trending this hashtag #NeverHillary!"

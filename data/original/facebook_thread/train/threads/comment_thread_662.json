    "text": "Watching Vice Presidential debate. Kaine is the rudest person ever interrupting and injecting, insulting and not telling truth. The moderator is weak and gets on Pence for doing what Kaine does with winks and smiles from Kaine to moderator. I am incensed at this. Kaine is as much a liar as Hilary Clinton. I don't usually write like this but the debates so far are clearly favoring democrats. The moderator lets Kaine go on and on and stops Pence. Disgusting"

He was the first political figure to arrive on the scene during the recent flooding in Louisiana, giving toys to the children there who lost everything, and 100,000.00 to a Church near my aunt's home in Walker. He is non stop visiting those of our nation in distress. What hasn't he sacrificed ? would be the proper question."

    "text": "I wish people would start talking about what happened during Bill's run. Everyone seems to have forgotten about Janet Reno, Waco, Ruby Ridge, and a Border Patrol Tactical Team running a snatch and grab on a small boy named Elian Gonzalez. His policy of deporting every illegal alien and building a wall along the border. Why is nobody talking about this and how Hilary treated and treats her current Secret Service Detail. We as a nation need a Joe The Plumber and Donald J. Trump is that man. It is time to get rid of the good old boy system."

Bar Exam • Was removed from her House Judiciary Committee staffer job because of incompetence and lying. • The Whitewater scandal. • Married a serial liar and cheater, who occasionally had sexual encounters with nonconsenting partners. • Lied about \"sniper fire\" in an attempt to simulate exposure to danger in a war zone. • The subject of a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" that led to the impeachment and disbarment of her husband • Took crockery, furniture, artwork and other items from the White House — had to return and/or pay for them. • Said \"what difference, at this point, does it make\" about four brave people killed in Libya as a direct result of her failure to protect them on the anniversary of 9/11. • Totally ignored the structure and rules for the handling of sensitive national security information. • Amassed a personal fortune with \"speaking fees\" and payments from private sector political donors and foreign governments into transparent \"foundations\" in obvious exchange for future political favor. I had to curtail this list because it exceeded the 8,000 character allowance!"

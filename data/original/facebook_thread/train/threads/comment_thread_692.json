    "text": "Just saw one of Hillary's gals defending the e-mails, and glossing over it ever so lightly and brushing it off. Her people are like robots. Always smiling, always putting up a fake front and lying with such authenticity. And rather than being outraged by what Wasserman-Schultz did, Hillary just changed her position - shows me that she knew about the e-mails, but rather than just throw Debbie under the bus, she offered her another position. It's really like they are all on a different planet - like they have been hypnotized or brain-washed - how can they all be so complacent in the face of so many cover-ups? They must get paid lots of money to forego their conscience..... I know I couldn't do it. I was taught right from wrong many, many years ago!!!!"

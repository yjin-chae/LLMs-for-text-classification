    "text": "Dear Mrs Clinton, I wish you wisdom, tolerance and class tonight. It will be difficult to remain cool and collected considering your opponent deplorable tactics - please don't feed into it, don't let him bring you down to his level - you are so much better than him, let him be the childish, bigot and uneducated man that he is - rise above all that, give our country the example of what a true leader is supposed to look, act and talk like. I am hopeful in my heart that the American people will be able to make the right choice... tonight is very important, for you and for our country. I send you light and positive energy - may the Force be with you, Mrs Clinton!"

I bet Monica Lewinsky's parents thought she deserved better also but this woman stood by her man. LOL She will be nothing but a pushover and none of the other leaders in the world will respect her."

      "text": "Henry Mr. Trump is not getting soft on immigration. Mr. Trump said he wants to secure our borders & Mr. Trump wants to Build a Wall on the southern border to keep illegals out of the US & Mr. Trump wants to stop the flow of illegal drugs from pouring into the US. Mr. Trump said he wants to get rid of Sanctuary Cities. I watched Mr. Trump do an interview on CNN with Anderson Cooper and Mr. Trump said he is going to deport all Illegals that have committed crimes & are a danger to our country & Mr. Trump said he is open to having the rest deported first & then if they want to come back to the US they will have to come in Legally. Mr. Trump also mentioned the illegals paying back taxes. I believe Mr. Trump is going to be tough on Immigration. Mr. Trump said he is going to make a speech in a few weeks on the complete details of his immigration plan. I have supported Mr. Trump since the start & I still support him. Henry I hope you will continue to support Mr. Trump as well!"

Here is a comment from a friend of an employee there from a post on WJAC TV's Facebook page. He can't attend and here is why......\" I know people that work there and it's not only closed to the public it's also closed to the people who work there!!! They were told she will be bringing her own people in to stage as workers as she speaks. And I'm serious, you can't make this stuff up!!!!!\" Forward this to all you know!!!!!!! My guess is her own people will be the ones asking questions she gave them!!! Thought the TRUMP folks would enjoy seeing this one! I'm a resident of Johnstown and can't say i'm surprised by ANOTHER Hillary Clinton Antic!!!! Trump for President!!!!"

      "text": "Not sure why you chose my post to respond to, but lucky me! I'm not voting for her because she's a woman (although it is a nice bonus), I'm voting for her because she's the most qualified person for the job. I'm voting for her because she's smart, she's tenacious, she's experienced, and she has spent her life advocating for and serving others. I'm voting FOR her enthusiastically and without reservation- not only because I'm voting *against* the alternative. The claim that she's a corrupt liar is not a new one; it's been thrown at her for decades by those seeking to undermine her work, despite the fact that it's unfounded. Luckily, it hasn't slowed her down! She's been the target of hate for years- to me, it's obvious that much of it is based in blatant sexism, and it's always disappointing to me when fellow women (especially educated women such an yourself) are swayed by it. I look forward to her being our president. As long as we also have a Congress that's willing to do their jobs and work together and with her, I think you may be pleasantly surprised by the next four (perhaps eight) years."

      "text": "Stop listening to Trump media and do some research. The Clinton Foundation is not a private charity and the family does not get this money, it is not part of their personal assets. It is a public charity, works like a clearing house for organizations (yes this may mean other countries) to distribute their money to the causes they want their money to go to. Sometimes they do not specifically choose a cause, so the foundation picks the cause, but typically they decide exactly where they want the money to go. When all of the Trump supporters mention that Clinton takes money from countries that do not support women's rights or LGBT rights for example, consider that not everyone in that country may have that mindset. There are many sides to a story, but we do not hear those because media is willing to let Trump lead the media train to satisfy their ratings."

Keep thinking these refugees (MANY, who want you dead) are your \"friends...\" We're already run by a Muslim, who \"protects radicals,\" named Obama ;) smh"

    "text": "On Sunday, nearly a billion Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists around the world—including more than two million Americans—will celebrate Diwali, the festival of lights. For members of these faiths, lighting the lamp (the diya) is a reminder that light prevails over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil.\n\nHere in the United States, it is a tribute to the Indian American community that Diwali is celebrated with such beauty and joy. Regardless of our personal faith, Diwali reminds us that diversity is one of our greatest strengths as a nation, that light prevails over darkness, and that dharma—righteousness or goodness—must guide us toward a better tomorrow. If I have the honor of serving as president, I will be committed to building an Administration that reflects such diversity, including continuing White House celebrations of Diwali.\n\nTo those of you celebrating this joyous occasion, I wish you and your loved ones a Happy Diwali and Saal Mubarak."

    "text": "When even Bernie Sanders says now is not the time for a protest vote, you should probably listen to him. Dear God, either Trump or Clinton will win this election. Please don't aid in Trump gaining any ground. Clinton has now adopted almost 80% of Bernie's platform. What don't people understand? Clinton will work with Bernie, and his ideas, while Trump is the opposite of everything we worked for. Trump doesn't believe in climate change, equal pay, changing the tax bracket so that the top 1% don't rule this country, the right to choose, the rights of LGTBQIA people, the rights of people of color, working with the outside world, or a new, clean, progressive energy system. We don't have the luxury to ponder a vote for a third-party candidate. If you TRULY believe that Clinton is evil, she's obviously the lesser of the two - and voting for a lesser-of-two-evils candidate who can win would be better than voting for an ideal candidate who will lose. I cannot state this emphatically enough: Whatever you think of Hillary Clinton, under no reasonable assessment is she \"just as bad\" as Donald Trump. The demonizing of Clinton reached a peak this week with the Republican convention acting as round-the-clock infomercial promoting the Lucifer-like qualities of Hillary. If a stupendous claim is made enough times, many will believe it―the truth is pliable. Clinton is far from a saint, but the truth about her record bears little resemblance to what Trump allies scream. Hillary's political opponents believe that she is highly capable―except when they are trying to beat her in an election. Then she is evil. There is no reason to apologize for supporting Hillary or hedge your bets by saying that both candidates are equally terrible. But, I understand that you may have deep philosophical differences with Clinton and are considering voting for a third party. Please think very hard before actually doing that. I support third parties and have voted for a few. But this is not the election to cast a presidential vote that way. #ImWithHer #GoHillary #Vote #VoteBlue #Election2016 #NoProtestVote #SandersVoterForClinton #ClimateChangeVoter #HillarysEmail"

      "text": "Like and Share! Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still \"with her,\" look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure: • The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless. • The media has been neutered forever. • Career politicians will have lost all job security. • The guns in your home will safely stay there. • Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference. • Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally • Iran will not get one more plane full of cash. • No more apologies to the world for being great! • Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared. • Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down. • There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state. • The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered. • The police will be supported so they can restore law and order. The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win. Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016."

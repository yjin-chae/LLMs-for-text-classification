We need a President for progress ,college, education, woman's right, men's right , peoples right, wages right, children right etc. Our slave Master is going to put us back in the plantation because we have no jobs. The immigrants will be gone and who is going to do the small jobs. Business owners have to pay more for wages. Forcing more business to go to China and Mexico. We need a President who sit and think through all the implications of the what if."

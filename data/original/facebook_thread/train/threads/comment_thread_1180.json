    "text": "Millions of Trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....\" We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him. The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and ISIS are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed! We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Cruz, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out. The country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of them, being invaded by illegals, they are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where they don't even recognize the country they were born and raised in, AND THEY JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want. We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation. Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction they're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of great things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar. Public service has become elected greed. This may be the only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. People must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to that country."

      "text": "A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter. Dear Mr. Trump, It's taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I'm grateful to you. For the past few months I've spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I've watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame. It's only lately I've come to understand that you haven't manufactured our current national ugliness—you've simply revealed it. By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you've given other like-minded people license to do the same. You've opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it. You've made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it's allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts. Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you \"speak your mind\". It wasn't until recently that I've realized that you speak their minds. You've given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream. Thanks to the terrible ground you've broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together. You've emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is. In other words, you've let us know what we're really dealing with here and while it's been rightly disturbing, it's also been revelatory. That's the thing about that kind of harsh light: you're forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated. Now don't get me wrong, I think you're the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I'd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you're reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully. But whether you win or lose, you've already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation. And in the process you've also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you've revealed about us. You've generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days. I find it in those for whom equality isn't just a cheap buzzword, it's the most precious of hills to die on. I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression. I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people. I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value. I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension. I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world. Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we've seen where that leads. Yes, Mr Trump, you've unearthed our hidden sickness and you've allowed it to go viral. You brought every awful thing about us out into the open. You will NEVER Get My Vote! Copy Paste Share!"

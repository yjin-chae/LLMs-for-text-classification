      "text": "There is no doubt that the USA is a more dangerous place and more racially divided than it has been in 40 years. Failed government Healthcare, slowest GDP growth rate in American history, an out of control debt. Black unemployment rate around 10%. Student loans are up, people that are on food stamps is up, money printing is up, health insurance cost is up. While median family income is down, new home ownership is down, worker's share economy is down. Wage increases haven't even come close to staying up with the cost of living increases. No more dynasties. No more Bushes no more Clinton's. We need term limits on all politicians Go to Washington serve your country then get out. You can't keep voting for the same corrupt career politicians and expect some great change, that doesn't make sense. Time to move into 21st century politics."

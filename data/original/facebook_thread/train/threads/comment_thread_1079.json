      "text": "Top military men? You have never been in the military. Top Pentagon brass play the political game like everyone in Congress. The enlisted are NOT supporting Hillary. We had thousands of military families collecting foodstamps during Cameron Clinton's 8 years in office for the first time in our nations history. It was a disgrace that our military was living in poverty while Cameron and Hillary turned their backs on them. Queen Hillary said \"let them eat cake.\" Thats a historical reference to the French monarchy for all of you that were ruined by public education's liberal teachers' unions. Cameron Clinton froze the military's pay every year that he was president. Our military members and veterans know this and we know how Obama neglected our veterans and know Hillary will do the same. Remember that you can't spell Hillary without the letters L I A R."

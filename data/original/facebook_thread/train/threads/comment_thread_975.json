Does that include remnants of the once superior U.S. Military? WAKE UP AMERICA, or do you really want a continuation of the broken Barry program?"

      "text": "Reality! Bernie had a no confidence vote from SD as well not having the popular vote! That doesn't mean he's useless! Another reality! Trump's electoral strength—and his staying power—have been buoyed, above all, by Americans with authoritarian inclinations! Take a good look at yourselves and Trump rather than trolling lies about Hillary and now Bernie! Just one reason Trump should never be POTUS! Trump's judgment is noxious! Trump: \"I Am The Law and Order Candidate\" Trump advertised to send men to their death who were actually to be proven innocent!! Trump's thinking is corrupt and his judgment sucks! Rather than trolling lies about Hillary, take a good look at Trump! \"Yusef Salaam was 15 years old when Donald Trump demanded his execution for a crime he did not commit. Nearly three decades before the rambunctious billionaire began his run for president – before he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, for the expulsion of all undocumented migrants, before he branded Mexicans as \"rapists\" and was accused of mocking the disabled – Trump called for the reinstatement of the death penalty in New York following a horrific rape case in which five teenagers were wrongly convicted. The miscarriage of justice is widely remembered as a definitive moment in New York's fractured race relations. But Trump's intervention – he signed full-page newspaper advertisements implicitly calling for the boys to die – has been gradually overlooked as the businessman's chances of winning the Republican nomination have rapidly increased. Now those involved in the case of the so-called Central Park Five and its aftermath say Trump's rhetoric served as an unlikely precursor to a unique brand of divisive populism that has powered his rise to political prominence in 2016.\" [ On May 1, 1989, Donald Trump took out full-page advertisements in all four major New York newspapers calling for the return of the death penalty. Trump said he wanted the criminals of every age who were accused of beating and raping a jogger in Central Park 12 days earlier to be afraid. The advertisement, which cost an estimated $85,000 said, in part, \"Mayor [Ed] Koch has stated that hate and rancor should be removed from our hearts. I do not think so. I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer ... Yes, Mayor Koch, I want to hate these murderers and I always will. ... How can our great society tolerate the continued brutalization of its citizens by crazed misfits? Criminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS!\"]"

You know, the sane tax law that Clinton's Labor Secretary pushed. Wikileaks emails proved Hildahag to be a racist, anti-Jew, anti-Catholic and anti-Muslim bigot. You're pathetic ðŸ˜‰"

      "text": "Does any of this scare you? There are eight levels of control that must be obtained before you can create a social state: 1. Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live. 3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty. 4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state. 5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income). 6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools. 8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor. But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, \"1984\", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that \"Big Brother\" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of \"news\"! Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says \"You don't know what you got until it's gone\"! Wake up and Vote for Trump, he is our only hope to rid our country of the stinking rotten corruption! If you don't know who George Soros is. Who Saul Alinsky was. What Agenda 21 or Agenda 30 is, and what Cloward-Piven means... educate yourself. Research these names tied with Clinton & Obama before you go to vote!! HELP ME SPREAD THE WORD, ..."

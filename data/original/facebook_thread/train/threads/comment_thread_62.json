You would vote for a crook that can't tell the truth and sent and received top secret documents over an unsecured server...sorry, I know I'm getting over your head.... Anyway, no disrespect here, but I do wish you would study up on Trump. I've read all his books and my hubby and I have followed him for 30+ years.... He is a good man."

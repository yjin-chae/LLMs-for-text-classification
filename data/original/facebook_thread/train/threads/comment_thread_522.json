    "text": "Wow and after looking at the comments on your page and this post the media is still lying by saying that you are ahead in the polls! Unbelievable! There is no way that you could be ahead in the polls! I know of two people that might be voting for you everyone else I talk to and know is all about Trump! We are tired of the lies and corrupt politics! Time to get some truth and someone with some bravery in the White House! Someone that's for Americans not against us!"

His campaign is a heinous insult to five thousand years of human civilization and to two hundred thirty-eight years of American democracy.\" Where's the love - Trump started his campaign with hate, dirty dirty slandering. I can't listen to this baffling idiot any longer or any one who follows his hate. Trump is a fraud, he is dangerous, and anyone who supports him supports his bigotry."

      "text": "Wow sounds like to me that you've been listening to mainstream media lies.. It's evident that you haven't listened to Trump himself in a full rally or speech. He's far from a bigot and as far as the name calling by Trump.. He has called lying Hillary crooked and that's because she is and he has called the main stream media bias and that's because they are. Truth is truth, some people just don't like the truth. So you think Trump is full of hate because he wants American citizens to come first and be safe in America and he want illegals to come in legally? He didn't actually make the laws up in our country he just would like to see them enforced. Who in their right mind would vote for a woman who is as crooked and deceitful at Hillary Clinton. I understand wanting a woman as president but don't waste a vote on a woman as crooked and deceitful as her. If anyone has brought division to our country it has been Barack Obama and Clinton. Our country has never been more divided than they are now with race wars on the brink and violent riots in our streets. Our police being shot up and targeted because they have no backing from this govt that we have. Clinton praises the parents of the young black men that have been shot when the fact is that if those young men would've been raised differently they may not of ended up in a situation to get themselves shot. ( and I'm not saying that every cop is in the right because there are some cops that were in the wrong, but the duty of our police officers is to protect the public and then go home to their families at the end of the day and when they are dealing with thugs that have no respect for authority then they have to be on high guard and do what they need to do if their lives are threatened). So Clinton honors the thugs families and Trump backs our police officers and supports them. Clinton wants to let in thousands more refugees playing patty cake with Isis and Trump supports our troops and vets and wants to make America safe. To me Clinton supporters are either 1- just simply not informed enough, or 2- they've been informed by liars and they believe lies or 3- they are just simply anti American. There's really no other way to explain why in the world a person In their right mind would vote for such a crooked woman. I really do feel bad for some that have been so blinded by mainstream media."

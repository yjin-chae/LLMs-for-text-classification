Republicans only do this stuff to make it seem like dems are bad when they are actually good for america and if everyone finds out that dems help america and repubs hurt america for their own self gains then dems would have full control of the house, senate and excutive branch forever and repubs wont be able to rip everyone off for their own financial gain ever again and that scares the heck out of the scammers in the 1% so they buy these lies to discredit the left. Truth!"

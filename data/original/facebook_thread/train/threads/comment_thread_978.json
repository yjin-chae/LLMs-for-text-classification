It means that my kids will be able to find good paying jobs, it means they can walk down the street and not have fear, it means being able to afford health care insurance, it means we can go to the mall and not worry about some terrorist wanting to blow the place up, it means that I can trust our government to make decisions on what is best for the WHOLE country not just themselves or a small group, it means we have the biggest baddest military in the world, it means a Supreme Court that upholds the laws and the Constitution, it means my grandchild will have a country that is better than it is now. That's what MAKE AMERICA GRAT AGAIN means to me."

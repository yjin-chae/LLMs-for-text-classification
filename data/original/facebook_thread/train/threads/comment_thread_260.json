    "text": "I'm a Muslim. Tell me how We have to choose the 'Lesser Evil'? Well there is absolutely no evidence that ary Clinton is the lesser evil! And even if she is, when the lesser evil is SO EVIL, it's not a choice! ary Clinton supporters would be responsible for the economic slavery and evil wars ary Clinton, her corporate owners and oligarch friends will wage all over the world. I won't be affected much by all that because fortunately I'm not poor. But the blood and sufferings of millions of people all over the world will be on those Clinton supporters because they didn't fight for Bernie Sanders and let the fear of Donald Trump make them support corrupt, evil, warmonger criminal ary Clinton. ary has a record of doing many of the things Trump only talks about. Trump won't be able to do most of that stuff, but Clinton will. Oh and I'm a Brown guy with a Muslim name who is supposed to be hated by Trump and his supporters but I still hope Clinton loses to Trump because I understand what America deserves and the world needs. Nothing and no one can make me budge from #Neverary #aryForPrison2016!"

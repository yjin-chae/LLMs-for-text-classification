    "text": "Both candidates are flawed. We all know that. But permit me an analogy: As a pastor, I would rather deal with a church attendee who is blatant and brash in his sinning than one who is devious, lying, cunning and deceptive. Both are problematic, but one is easier to deal with than the other. If I were a pastor bringing correction to a parishioner, I would prefer dealing with a \"Trump-type\" any day over a \"Hillary-type.\" The chances of making progress with the \"Trump-type\" are many times greater than the \"Hillary-type.\""

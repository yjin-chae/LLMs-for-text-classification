      "text": "\"For those who are still undecided, here are some highlights on presidential candidate Bernie Sanders ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Bernie wants to make healthcare available for everyone as a right, so neither you or your employer will have to pay health insurance directly, it's just provided for everyone as a human right through a small tax that will replace your current health insurance payments. His plan will end up saving the US $6 billion in the next decade compared to what we currently spend on health care and will actually SAVE the average household about 5,000 every year and the average business about $10,000 a year. We are the ONLY major country in the world that doesn't provide health care for their people as a right. He wants to make sure all women get at least 12-weeks of medical leave after having a baby so they can get to know their new child and learn to be a mom (this plan will only cost americans $1.61 a week) and he wants pay equality for women. He has a 50-year history of standing up for civil and minority rights and was even present at MLK's \"I have a dream\" speech. He wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 gradually within 4 years, a plan which top economists agree will strengthen our economy because the more money people make, the more they spend on products and services. When companies sell more products and services, they make more money and hire more people to meet those demands. This plan improves the quality of life and income for individuals as well as businesses. He wants to cap credit card interest rates at 15%, he wants to cap ATM fees at $2 because people shouldn't have to pay up to $4.50 ($2 from the ATM and $2 or $2.50 for using a different bank than your own) to take out THEIR OWN money especially since ATM's save the banks money. He wants to equip the postal service with minor banking abilities so people in poor neighborhoods don't have to go to paycheck advance places and get ripped off. He wants to keep the police accountable when someone dies while in custody. He wants to end private prisons (the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world and has more people currently in prison than China - a COMMUNIST country with 4.3 times as many people as the US. He wants to give students the ability to refinance their student loans at a lower percentage rate and he acknowledges that a college degree is the same as a high school diploma in today's world and he feels that nobody should be deprived of an education because of their income or inability to pay off loans so he wants to make public colleges and universities tuition-free, this will be paid for through a tax on wall street speculation (high-risk investments). He feels it's wrong that the taxpayers bailed them out and they still gave themselves millions in bonuses and changed little of their behavior so it's their time to pay their fare share. He wants to break up \"too big to fail\" banks to prevent another financial collapse. He also wants to put those that caused the financial collapse in jail. He argues that a kid can go to jail for years and have their life and record ruined for smoking marijuana but the crooks on wall street that destroyed the lives of billions of people all over the world with their reckless behavior and greed just got a $700 billion bailout and a slap on the wrist. He wants to end loopholes that save companies like wal-mart billions ($6 billion last year) while they push their employees to sign up for government assistance and he wants to end loopholes that allow companies to keep their money stashed in the cayman islands and other \"tax havens\". He wants to close loopholes that allow people to buy guns online and at gun shows without background checks. He tries to avoid war which saves us trillions, he wants to take big money out of politics so the US can be a democracy again. He wants to expand social security so that when you retire, you have a decent income to keep you alive and happy, not just barely getting by. He's only 5 years older than Donald Trump, 6 years older than Hillary Clinton and 5 years YOUNGER than John McCain whose age became an issue 8 years ago when he ran against Obama and he's still alive and well. Today, 62 people own HALF of the world's wealth...5 years ago that number was 388... Bernie cares about people like you and I...and he's funded by people like you and I...he's literally received more individual contributions ($27 average) than ANY presidential candidate EVER at this point in the race....all the other people running for president are funded by the same people that are turning america into a place where only the ultra-rich and powerful have a say in what goes on. #berniesanders #sandstorm #feelthebern #bernie2016 Sharing is encouraged ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸\""

    "text": "Here is a speech I put together and you can use it with some edit I'm sure.To my husband and the American people I am talking to you tonight to let you know how much I love Donald and what he can do for this country. Donald has plans to make America great again. Let me tell you just a few things he is working on at this minute. He is planning to build the wall. He has Ben Carson re writing Obamacare which will become Trump Care. We have picked a VP Mr. Pence. He has great talents to turn around our economy situation like he did for Indiana. Donald grew up as a caring person. He has a big heart. He also helps the city of New York City several times in the past. He cares about the people that are working two to three jobs so they can keep a roof over their heads. That's why he is running for President. He is going to bring back jobs. He is going to bring back the middle class. Our military will be stronger too. We will conquer ISIS with the help of Russia. We will bring back space programs for the younger generation who always wanted to be an astronaut. Where Obama killed that program and there was no future in the eyes of young men and women looking at the sky and wonder will I ever make it out there. I say to you now there is no such thing as Irish-American, Italian-American, African-American there is only one name for all of us WE ARE ALL AMERICANS. We need to call ourselves the proper term which is I am an American and proud of it. Let's hear it for Donald Trump‚Ä¶."

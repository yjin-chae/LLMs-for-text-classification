I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.  Anyone who knows me, know these words don't reflect who I am.\n\nI said it, it was wrong, and I apologize.\n\nI've travelled the country talking about change for America. But my travels have also changed me.  I've spent time with grieving mothers who've lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I've been humbled by the faith they've placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down.\nLet's be honest.  We're living in the real world.  This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today.  We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were 8 years ago and Washington is broken.\nHillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground.\n\nI've said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days.\n\nSee you at the debate on Sunday."

You are in no way qualified to be President and the fact that you knew you made these comments and countless others and simply hid them show great dishonesty on your part. If you had any humility whatsoever you would bow out before this further embarrasses your family and brings about the ruin of the Republican party. I cannot support Hillary but you will not get my vote. I will be voting for the Libertarian ticket and hope that any conservative with actual conscience will abandon this morally bankrupt person. Both of these candidates are simply indefensible."

What men haven't talked about plowing women at some point in their life? Yeah Its embarrassing. I would venture to say lots of men have had inappropriate conversations behind closed doors. The dynamic of the world is way more important than focusing on Trump being a playboy in his heyday"

I guess we have different standards of what we want to project as our image to the world. You can have your morally bankrupt candidates and make excuses for them all you want. Tell your daughters of nieces about how you helped get Donald \"GrabthemBythePussy\" Trump in to he White House."

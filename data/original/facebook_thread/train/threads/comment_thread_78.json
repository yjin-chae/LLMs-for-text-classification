You can't lie about 33,000 emails, allow ISIS to spread, and call millions of hard-working Americans \"deplorables!\" I will bring BIG CHANGE on DAY ONE. #AmericaFirst! #NotHillary!"

He should know the media is all for Hillary. He needs to stay focused and and push his policy. He needs to let some of the small things like Miss Universe and the bias media go."

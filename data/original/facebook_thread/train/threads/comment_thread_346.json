    "text": "The FBI is ready to indict Hillary Clinton and if its recommendation isn't followed by the U.S. attorney general, the agency's investigators plan to blow the whistle and go public with their findings, former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay tells Newsmax TV. The FBI says when Hillary Clinton to be indicted and that process begins, or we try her in the public eye with her campaign. One way or another she's going to have to face these charges.\" Team Hillary is already admitting this will likely happen. Amazingly, the Clinton campaign has been busy accusing Obama's intelligence Inspector General, Charles McCullough, of coordinating releases of information to help Republicans. (!) McCullough's investigations found Clinton was sharing documents which were \"beyond top secret\"… a crime that should not only disqualify Hillary Clinton from the White House, but should carry a lengthy prison sentence!

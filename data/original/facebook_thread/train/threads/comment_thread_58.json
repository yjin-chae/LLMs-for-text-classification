    "text": "I urge all Trump supporters to boycott the media. Call them out, email them, write letters to them to call out their bias against Trump, and that they need to be professional and report, not give opinion, the news. Where's their coverage on the Wikileaks? #BoycottCNN #BoycottMSNBC #BoycottABCNews #BoycottCBSNews #BoycottNBCNews #CallThemOut"

A witness has also come out against Ms Leeds accusing her of lying as well. I believe when the lies are revealed Trump will win. https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/statement-from-john-barry Trump 2016! Share everywhere."

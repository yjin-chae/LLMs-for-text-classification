Which is why I hate social media because it is completely brainwashing everyone in this election.. Your just waiting to say and do all the corruption when you get in office which hopefully will never happen. These are the two candidates we get stuck with out of all the amazing people we have in the U.S? Either way I am voting for Trump.. He has a better track record than this woman."

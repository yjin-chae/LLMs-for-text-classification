It is fair to do the same with this, since the Bureau advised Comey against releasing the vague letter he wrote to Congress 11 days before the election. These emails haven't even been reviewed, this could have waited. Who is to say that these are duplicates of already reviewed emails? It's clearly an attempt to meddle with the election and he should be fired regardless of the investigations outcome."

Better yet, why would Anthony Wiener be privy to national security secrets, I highly doubt that he has been read into classified programs. I don't think this round is as big of a deal as people want to make it."

    "text": "Never in the modern history of America have we had a presidential candidate give such a response to this question. Clinton made sure to point out how disrespectful this was to the very values that America was built upon. She said: \"He is denigrating. He is talking down our democracy. I am appalled.\" And the rest of us should be as well. Trump has created a truly dangerous climate built upon fear, violence and hatred. Trump has basically said that he isn't going to walk away from this election peacefully if he loses, and it could very well create deadly tension between his supporters and the rest of America. It's never been more clear that Trump is not an answer for America â€“ he is a threat."

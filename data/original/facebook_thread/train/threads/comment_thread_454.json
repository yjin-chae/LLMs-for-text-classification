      "text": "the biggest negative of the debate wasn't Trump going after Hillary or Hillary going after Trump, but the condescending arrogant attitude of Hillary where she addressed any criticisms of her. His criticisms are the same ones most of America has, yet she laughed them off as if they didn't matter. Nobody wants their concerns laughed at by a Washington elitist who thinks they're above the law. Even if she doesn't think his critiques were valid, she could have at least addressed them with poise and class, but instead she chose to laugh at them in a mocking manner as if they were invalid or not worth addressing. It shows, that just as she laughs at the laws she avoided, she laughs at the people who would hold her accountable if she was elected and would do so if we questioned her choices as president. Sorry, but we have someone like that in office now, and look where that's gotten us. To the contrary, Trump took the people's concerns seriously and tried to address them as they came up rather than laughing about them and acting like they're no big deal. In fact, he took time out of other responses to be able to do so, which says a lot about him and how he views the opinions of those he wishes to govern - they actually matter"

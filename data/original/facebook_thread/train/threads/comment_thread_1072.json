Attempting to protect Crooked Hillary, NOT our American service members or national security information, is absolutely DISGRACEFUL. The American people deserve so much better. On November 8th, we will END this RIGGED system once and for all!"

    "text": "Mr. Trump. I don't want to think I would have to live under a Hillary regime for 4 years. I realize you get thousands if not millions of tweet and FB comments daily. From what I have seen and can gather, people are voting for Hillary simply because they want a woman in office. These types are uninformed, do no research on issues or the corruption of the Clinton's. Most probably have no internet access or don't know how to use a computer. They simply rely on news that the biased media reports and make their minds up based on that. Please find a way within the next couple of weeks to reach these very low income voters and people who are not used to or do not know how to research candidates and their stance on issues. Please figure out a way to show these people how to look up and investigate the corruption of the Clinton's. Millions do not know this. Informing them will sway their vote. If you need help, I would do anything I can to get you into office sir!!!!!"

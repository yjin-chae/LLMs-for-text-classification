      "text": "Better hurry and get those people voted before wikileaks guys again. Just a month away until we elect Hillary Clinton the next president! Make sure to get everyone you know to vote! Your voice matters! #StrongerTogether #ImWithHerðŸ’™ Are you a doctor? Are you a paid troll outside of the USA for Hillary Clinton? Never forget Benghazi! Trump would never leave our service people behind, because that's not what Americans do! But Hillary did. TRUMPS GOING DOWN HARD NOV.8 Hillary has shown us again and again for thirty years the only person she is out to protect and defend is herself and her husband. Sure, Trump's comments weren't pretty, but put into perspective Hillary downright terrifies me. Ok call me old school call me what ever. But I am finding that the values in commercials are no more. I really hate your current commercial where you have two grown men sitting at a table with crowns on their heads. Sayin \" two whoppers,two fries,two drinks only $10 someone is going to loose their job.\" Not cool dont you think you should show the two men talking to a cashier about the price of their food and have a cashier say well that is what happens when you eat at Burger King you get more fo your dollar? instaed of teaching youth who watch this to possibly be dishonest? I know I know it is not just a commercial that is going to make someone dishonest it is how they are raised but I just think it is wrong how these two adult men are ok with someone possibly loosing their job at their gain. 5 minutes ago i ordered a whopper jr meal with a coke icee. Well like always the coke was out. So i asked for cherry instead. I get a large and a regular. Well the regular is a kids cup filled halfway!! I get up charged for getting an icee but the cup size is a kiddie cup?!! Im beyond heated!! This company cant get keep the icee cups stocked and the icee machine running dont sell them!!! Im pretty sure once i take one sip of this the whole drink will be gone!"

    "text": "Dear Hillary, I am writing you this letter to show you all my support. I am an European citizen from Spain living in Barcelona. I always believed the American dream still exists, and this maybe it is possible in a way as we have had American politicians like you are. My heart is broken thinking someone like D. Trump might win the election for president, this also scares me in Europe. I followed your campaign and I admire you as a woman and as a politician. You represent all I trust in and all I want to become in the future. I know Europeans like me of course we can not participate in the internal political elections of the 8th of November but my heart is voting for you on the next election. I believe in the already great America you represent. I believe in the America of equality, freedom and liberty your are working for. I trust in your America based on diversity, respect and love. I even more love your fight to make more accessible the right of a universal health care for all people in your country. I dream in an America where people in Texas only carry books to university and not guns. Guns shoot bullets, books bring knowledge to human beings. I believe America is ready to elect the first woman for president, as your great nation showed already in the past that is a diverse country having the first black president with President Obama. I believe America has a place for LGTB communities and also refugees for what it represents globally as a modern nation. My heart, my European heart is with her. I am on the side of secretary Clinton. My heart will be always with those who are approachable and honest like you, with those who build and do not destroy, with those who integrate instead of divide or separate people, with those that simply respectc life and human beings. Americans please, you all have a very big responsibility. What you will vote will not only affect you as a country, will probably affect all citizens of this planet. We live globally and we must make decisions thinking globally. Wake up and go to vote, vote for her, vote for progress and vote for what your great nation means already, vote for your own freedom and ours overseas. Hillary you are smart and brilliant woman, and all I want to feel when next week comes is to see you as the first woman elected president of the united states. I want to open my eyes and see America took the great and right decision. You have dedicated all your life to work for the citizens of America throughout your political career. D. Trump only dedicated his entire life to make money from the citizens of America. If there is still the American dream, this dream has your name on it. I am with her in Europe, better said, we the Europeans, are with her. I hope one day I can be part of this wonderful and great nation called United states of America. Let's be united, let's be with her. America and Americans please, just stay great with her. Kind regards, Tiffany ."

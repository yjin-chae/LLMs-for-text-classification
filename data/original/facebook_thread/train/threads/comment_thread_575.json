      "text": "The prophecies indicate that the \"false trumpet\" is obviously \"Trump\" and the antichrist of 2020 so you just need him in power enough time to sprout the horrible wars to come, to complete the prophecies and yea Hillary may be corrupt and anything else you want but who cares. I rather be on Gods side. No war. I rather wait for the second coming in economic ruins than wait in wastelands by devastating wars, that the \"false trumpet\" will ignite, prophecies can have negative and positive effects, depending on the choices people make, voting for Hillary only to prevent ww3 and she wants UNIFICATION which is what God sent from the east \"sun myung moon\" wanted, look him up. Im smart enough to know God wants people together and not divided."

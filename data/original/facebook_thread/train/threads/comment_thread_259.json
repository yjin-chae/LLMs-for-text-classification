      "text": "The quality of our dream state is both a reflection of our thoughts and actions as well as a foreshadowing of the fate of our souls in the next life....Heed your dream state Trump supporters, it's telling you to change; and once you do, the nightmares will cease. Complexity(üåé)+Beauty(üå∑) =Intent(‚ù§Ô∏è) The Figure 8 Analogy: An analogy on life, death, the dreamstate and the symbolism intertwined within the human experience. We human beings are not moving in the -abstract- motion of a straight line towards death(for instance the numerical straight line of say 1-89), rather we are moving in the motion of a figure 8. The Figure 8 is a natural repeating pattern that is divided into two halves and is thus the perfect symbol to represent the human life cycle and our two primary states of existence that we are continuously moving in and out of -the awake state and the dream-state. When we awake from sleep, we come full circle to when we fall back asleep (represented by the bottom half of the figure 8) and when we go into the dream-state, we come full circle to when we awake from the dream-state (represented by the top half of the figure 8)...Upon death, the figure 8 of life untwines, but it is not the body untwining from the mind that this analogy represents; It's two states of mind untwining to form a larger state of mind. 8-0 .Because the awake state is really a state of mind with our body's physical reality \"consciously\" intertwined, and the dream-state is also a state of mind with our body's physical reality \"subconsciously\" intertwined. Therefore; upon death, these two states \"of mind\" untwine to form a larger state of mind -a state with all the potentialities of the dream world(flying, telepathy, psychokinesis, etc) combined with all the actualities of the awake world(nature, form, bonds, etc). This I refer to as the \"transitional analogy.\" While conceiving this analogy I realized life and death must be perceived -from one point of view- as seperate entities(the transitional analogy) but must also be perceived -from another point of view- as inseperable entities(the symbolic analogy) both of which are linked by the dream-state. The symbolic analogy consists of the untwined figure 8 of life/the 'circle of death' -abstractly overlapping the 'circle of life'/the earth, with the overlappment representing the dream state -like the common area in a venn diagram, which implies that the dream state is just as much a part of life as is of death (by which semi-explains precognitive dreams, prodromal dreams, \"visitations\" by deceased relatives, etc, for the dream state has a foothold in the afterlife) and is based on the premise that \"while our body sleeps, our dream state symbolically represents the state that awaits upon our body's ultimate rest. In other words, while we are lying down and -sleeping/dreaming, this natural process symbolizes where we go when we're ultimately lying down/dead ~to a place \"like\" our dream state...A state \"of mind\" with our body's physical bonds eternally engrained and intertwined. üëÅ~8~üëÅ"

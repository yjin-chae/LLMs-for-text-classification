    "text": "Dear Hillary, You need the UN or a Communist flag. Maybe your pals in Hanoi could lend you one. What you did during the Vietnam War disgraced our servicemen. What would have all those who died for our nation -including the Civil War- think of you and your lies and this corrupt administration? I am praying for a miracle. It seems that you are given a pass for everything. Perhaps your supporters could pay for all the money you ripped off on your trips as SOS to enrich you and your filthy friends. Sincerely, Rick the Vet"

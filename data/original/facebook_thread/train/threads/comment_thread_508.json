      "text": "So you voting for Hillary . Caleb I blame you All Of A Sudden....Seven Short Years Have Passed!\" Before Obama there's was virtually no outlandish presence of Islam in America. • All of a sudden, Islam is taught in schools. Christianity and the bible are banned in schools. • All of a sudden we must allow prayer rugs everywhere and allow for Islamic prayer in schools, airports and businesses. • All of a sudden we must stop serving pork in prisons. • All of a sudden we are inundated with law suits by Muslims who are offended by American culture. • All of a sudden we must allow burkas to be worn everywhere even though you have no idea who or what is covered up under them. • All of a sudden Muslims are suing employers and refusing to do their jobs if they personally deem it conflicts with Sharia Law. • All of a sudden the Attorney General of the United States vows to prosecute anyone who engages in \"anti-Muslim speech\". • All of a sudden, Jihadists who engage in terrorism and openly admit they acted in the name of Islam and ISIS, are emphatically declared they are NOT Islamic by our leaders and/or their actions are determined NOT to be terrorism, but other nebulous terms like 'workplace violence.\" • All of a sudden, it becomes Policy that Secular Middle East dictators that were benign or friendly to the West, must be replaced by Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood. • All of a sudden our troops are withdrawn from Iraq and the middle east, giving rise to ISIS. • All of a sudden, America has reduced it's nuclear stockpiles to 1950 levels, as Obama's stated goal of a nuke-free America by the time he leaves office continues uninterrupted. • All of a sudden, a deal with Iran must be made at any cost, with a pathway to nuclear weapons and HUNDREDS of BILLIONS of dollars handed over to fund their programs. • All of a sudden America APOLOGIZES to Muslim states and sponsors of terror worldwide for acts of aggression, war and sabotage THEY perpetrate against our soldiers. • All of a sudden, the American Navy is diminished to 1917 Pre-World War I levels of only 300 ships. The Army is at pre-1940 levels. The Air Force scraps 500 planes and planned to retire the use of the A-10 Thunderbolt close air support fighter. A further draw down of another 40,000 military personnel is in progress. • All of a sudden half of our aircraft carriers are recalled for maintenance by Obama rendering the Atlantic unguarded, NONE are in the Middle East. • All of a sudden Obama has to empty Guantanamo Bay of captured Jihadists and let them loose in Jihad-friendly Islamic states. He demands to close the facility. • All of a sudden America will negotiate with terrorists and trade FIVE Taliban commanders for a deserter and Jihad sympathizer. • All of a sudden there is no money for American poor, disabled veterans, jobless Americans, hungry Americans, or displaced Americans but there is endless money for Obama's \"Syrian refugee\" resettlement programs. • All of sudden there is an ammunition shortage in the USA. • All of a sudden, the most important thing for Obama to do after a mass shooting by two Jihadists, is disarm American Citizens. * All of a sudden, the President of the United States can not attend the Christian Funerals of a Supreme Court Justice and a former First Lady because of previous (seemingly unimportant) commitments. ... \"By his fruits you will know him.\" All of a sudden, I am sick to my stomach. Yes yes yes blame the Democrats"

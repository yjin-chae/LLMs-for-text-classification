    "text": "I'll believe this when I actually see Hillary Clinton make this promise come true. Not likely since this runs counter to the interests of those who are are her number one supporters. But, since she is counting on the ignorance of the voting public to carry her to he White House, she knows that this promise will sound good enough until November to win the votes she needs. Her real supporter know better, and so aren't threatened by a promise they know she won't keep."

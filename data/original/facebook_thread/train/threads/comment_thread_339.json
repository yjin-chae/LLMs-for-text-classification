Do you think she will get the medal of honor from bath house barry for her marvelous bravery under such intense fire on the tarmac in Bosnia? I'm not sure I approve of her giving Russia about 25% of our uranium reserve however even if she did get millions of dollars of bribe money for the deal."

      "text": "it makes me nervous when Hillary Clinton misses opportunities to set the historical record straight, and place responsibility where it rightfully belongs. She didn't do that tonight, but she needs to going forward. As often as Trump tries to rewrite history, she needs to remind us what really happened. Then, citizen Kayla, Americans won't make the same mistakes we made before...like when Hillary and Colin Powell and the majority of Congress and the majority of Americans trusted and believed the Bush and Cheney lies to invade Iraq!"

This kind of situation will create more nations with nuclear arsenals. World needs a strong US-President, who is free from capitalistic lobbyists. Donald Trump can take his own decisions free from global capitalists, who don't hesitate to create war and anarchy in nation the world for personal interests. For the sake world peace, please give Donald Trump power to get things done."

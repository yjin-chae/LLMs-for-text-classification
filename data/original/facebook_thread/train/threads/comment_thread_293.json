      "text": "When a guy like Trump asks the former head of Fox to work on his team. When the same head of Fox has just been fired for trying to lure Fox employees to bed and harassing them sexually. When men like Guiliani and Gingrich, known for their womanizing and divorces are also Trump spokes persons, then I'd say those men are not respectful of women, especially one like Hillary."

Whose morals should we be concerned with?"

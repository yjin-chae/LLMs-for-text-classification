    "text": "Here is my statement.\n\nI've never said I'm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I'm not.  I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.  Anyone who knows me, know these words don't reflect who I am.\n\nI said it, it was wrong, and I apologize.\n\nI've travelled the country talking about change for America. But my travels have also changed me.  I've spent time with grieving mothers who've lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I've been humbled by the faith they've placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down.\nLet's be honest.  We're living in the real world.  This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today.  We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were 8 years ago and Washington is broken.\nHillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground.\n\nI've said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days.\n\nSee you at the debate on Sunday."

      "text": "Trump seems to need Psychiatric help. What has caused him to think that women are as worthless as he constantly voices? Personally I hope that he will crawl back into his gilded gold penthouse very soon. He sees women primarily as an object of his sexual desires, and not much else. No apology or multiple apologies can ever wipe your slate clean."

As well as most of the naive women on here that actually believe their husbands have never talked like this ðŸ™„"

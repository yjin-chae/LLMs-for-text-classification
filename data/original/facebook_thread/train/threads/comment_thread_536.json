      "text": "Yes, I don't mind my taxes going up if Hillary wins. We have to get money for the 750,000 Syrian refugees that are given a minimum of 5 years of free rent, food stamps, & medical care!! We also need more money for the free college & internet for everyone. I sure hope she has a plan for jobs though. She is giving all kids a minimum wage raise up to $12.00 per hour, but Burger King, Arby's, McDonald's, basically all fast food, is going with robots if this happens. In my town there are two factories left, but when we get TPP approved, which is exciting, my factories are leaving. I don't understand why they are so upset! I don't mind paying a higher electric, water, & cable Bill, after all its worth it to vote for a woman and climate change! I figure if 3 families live together, which is happening now, 6 adults work, everyone can eat and share cars! We don't need vacations, etc. Anymore, it's worth it having a women for president."

    "text": "The news about Putin and his interference in a U.S. presidential election -- via his close ties to Donald Trump -- have been ignored in the media. While sheer innuendo and wishful thinking of Republicans regarding Weiner's emails have now made the top of 4 news cycles. Not to mention the new lawsuit against Trump in Brazil - the news of which just broke this past weekend and YOU heard NOTHING about it here. It was all about Hillary's emails instead. But there is a big lawsuit against Trump just filed this past week in Rio. I want our U.S. media to publish a comprehensive list of ALL the REAL lawsuits pending against Trump - not just in the U.S. but in all other countries in which he is being sued. I want to know the basic court charges. I want to know who brought the cases and why. Why is it that the Republicans manipulate the media to keep anything negative about Hillary -- even when it is just wishful thinking and innuendo on their part - no real charges.... no REAL lawsuits, yet her opponent Donald Trump gets by scott free - with no limelight on his many, many lawsuits. The American voters DESERVE to know ALL the lawsuits that are pending against him -- not just in the U.S. but all over the world. Somebody please give us that information and spend at LEAST 4 to 6 news cycles on it."

She bartered our Country's Uranium and more to create this vast fortune with Government Connections. In the process she hid numerous emails resulting in Criminal Investigations with the FBI."

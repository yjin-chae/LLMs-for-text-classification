Also out: When Comey said a prosecutor would not prosecute, even though he made it clear she was guilty, it's because corruption went clear to the top! Even Obama! Wake up America! Please do your own research! Hillary is for open borders & TPP! She has been lying to us. She is for wealthy only! She will destroy America! This is election is the most important election in history! We have been setup for One World Order!"

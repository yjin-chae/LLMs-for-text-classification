      "text": "Warning: The following contains factual information. Not suitable for Trump supporters. Illegal immigration is out of control There are an estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the United States. That's a serious problem no matter what sort of solution you favor. But claims that migrants are illegally entering this country in droves are sharply exaggerated. First, according to Politifact, \"the best-available metric [of illegal immigration rates], Border Patrol apprehensions, reached a 44-year national low in 2015.\" Another Politifact study, in 2015, reported that \"the total number of illegal immigrants has essentially held constant in recent years, because the number arriving has roughly balanced the number going home or getting legal status,\" according to Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies. In addition, according to the Pew Research Center, \"More Mexican immigrants have returned to Mexico from the U.S. than have migrated [into the U.S.] since the end of the Great Recession.\" Illegal immigration and the presence of so many undocumented people in the United States is a serious problem, but the evidence suggests at least the problem has stabilized in recent years.

    "text": "Time to start talking the issues. I honestly don't care what someone does in their personal life or what they said how many years ago. Now Bubba sure did a lot of things to women ..and not just saying stuff that men say every day.. in every day life and Hillary abused those women..attacked them and threatened them. So let's get back to what she will do in this nation that will effect us..not some gossip column.."

No problem I don't care that you don't like men..but I do care that you are using something someone said over a decade ago..to distract from who you are.. and all that you have told us is a lie.."

I'm shocked you aren't shocked by that. I'm shocked at the language some of your buds from the music industry use in their rap music. They don't just demean women with talk abt rape and insults, they also talk abt violence against police. I'm shocked that after a 40+ year marriage to a serial misogynist, accused rapist and full time whoremonger, that admitted his affair with Gennifer Flowers after you said you'd crucify her, it's shocking that some locker room talk between two private citizens is beyond what you can handle . I'm shocked that after working with Huma Abedin Weiner for 20 years, she didn't give you a play by play of her husband's disgusting antics. I'm shocked that you don't mind scooping up money from the Saudi's and other nations that abuse women, beat them for looking at men, mutilate their genitals and more. I'm shocked that the female parts mentioned in Trump's comments are the same parts little baby girls have before your pals at Planned Parenthood dissect and slice them up and sell them like auto parts, and I'm shocked you've never stood up for those baby girls."

My husband and I used to have Mr. President dirty talk all the time in private about Monika and Mr. President! Wink, wink. And Bill lied till the end about it and it blows. Vote TRUMP and then maybe, just maybe we can have our Country back from where Hiliary and Obama has put us. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN"

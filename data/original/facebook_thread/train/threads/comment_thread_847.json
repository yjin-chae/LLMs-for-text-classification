      "text": "Many politicians go to Washington, D.C. and then become rich during their terms. Hillary and Kayla are already rich: Hillary is rich times 2, while Kayla is rich times 40. Think of how easy it will be for Hillary to become as wealthy as Kayla is now- while Kayla becomes a Kaylaionaire. Remember that to have a lousy $200,000 in the bank for the Clintons is to be \"flat broke.\""

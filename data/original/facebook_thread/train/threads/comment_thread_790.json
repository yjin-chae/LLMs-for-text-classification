I'll vote for Trump because he's not a career criminal like she is and he doesn't have American blood on his hands like she does. As a soldier who's been in combat and has seen the horrors of war I will NEVER be ok with what Hillary did in Benghazi NEVER. I care more about that than what Trump said. Plain and simple! So you can seat there and bring bs like this all day long, at the end of the day he is the better candidate of them both. You're outraged by Trump's words but not by Hillary's actions. That's what's wrong with this country. It says a lot about who you are as a person and what you stand for if you vote and support a lying criminal like her."

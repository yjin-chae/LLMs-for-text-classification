She's just another arm of Crooked Hillary's RIGGED system -- coordinating with convicted criminals and paying people to start violence at my rallies! The system is UNBELIEVABLY RIGGED and believe me, as President, I will END the corruption and once again, your government will be by, for and of the people! #DrainTheSwamp  #RIGGED"

I read that takes place in Countries where corruption and dictatorships took over. People get so tired of seeing it, listening to it, then as a defense mechanism, they ignore it. Might be a good idea to say to the people before the election that this is taking place and everyone must stand firm in the face of corruption, we must stand together or lose the Country as we know it. Have your speech writers come up with something glorious, it may put you over the top, a real serious speech about the hazards and emotions of corruption."

It's extremely sad that Paul Ryan, who just endorsed him, said that his comments about the judge is the definition of being racist. His supporters say he's a \"leader\" and will do \"anything\" to do that job. What people don't understand is that there are both positive and negative leaders. Trump is not a positive leader."

    "text": "The repercussions just keep rolling in: Hillary Clinton's recent decision to call Donald Trump's fans a \"basketful of deplorables\" has turned into \"nothing short of a crisis\" for the Democratic presidential nominee, says veteran pollster John Zogby. Ah, but it gets worse. \"The entire fainting and pneumonia issue is nothing short of a disaster,\" he continues, noting that the distress and drama of Mrs. Clinton's health challenges have prompted voters to ask visceral questions about her truthfulness and judgment. \"This has all been badly done. New polls have come out that show Clinton down 5 points in Ohio, down in Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada and Iowa — and none of these polls reflect more than just one day's sample. A new CBS Tracking Poll now shows her leading Trump 42 percent to 40 percent. I probably shouldn't speculate, but I suspect she will lose a few more points,\" Mr. Zogby continues. \"But the real crisis here is how she gets back on track. She will most likely have a good debate performance on Sept. 26. But then she still has to deal with the 'deplorables' thing because of what it reveals about her and her supporters. And then the release of her emails in October. She is in a tough spot.\" YOU MAY BE DEPLORABLE IF — A round of applause for Boston Herald columnist Howie Carr, who reaches out to those who support Donald Trump, otherwise known as \"deplorables\" these days. But how do you know if you're a proud deplorable? A partial list of Mr. Carr's suggestions: \"You may be a deplorable if you stand for the National Anthem. Or if you know all the words to the Pledge of Allegiance, especially, 'under God.' If you're deployable, you're definitely deplorable. Saying Merry Christmas — Deplorable with a capital D!\" writes Mr. Carr. \"You may be a deplorable if you wouldn't mind showing some ID at the local precinct before you vote. You are most assuredly a deplorable if you have more than one job,\" he continues. \"Nothing says deplorable like the National Rifle Association. You may be a deplorable if you don't think you should have to press one for English. Or if you believe that good fences make good neighbors. You're most definitely a deplorable if you have an American flag flying in your front yard. You are a deplorable if you believe All Lives Matter. If you've never needed a 'safe space,' or heeded a 'trigger warning' — you're deplorable.\""

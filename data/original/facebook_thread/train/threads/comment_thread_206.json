    "text": "When other Americans hurt we all hurt. Many people don't think about it, but it is true. So many people are so focused on getting ahead or doing what is best for themselves, that we now have a society that is controlled by selfishness and greed that is tearing this country apart. We were a country that loved freedom, liberty, and justice, but now we are a country that loves power and money. We are becoming like all other empires and countries before us. We will no longer be that country that is the burning light on the hill."

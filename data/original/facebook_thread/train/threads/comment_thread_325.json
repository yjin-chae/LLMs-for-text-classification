    "text": "Reportedly Gennifer Flowers has accepted Donald Trump invitation to attend the debates and sit in the front row in an attempt to intimidate Hillary (in retaliation for Hillary inviting Mark Cuban). If this is true, then the dirt has started. Well, if Trump is going to go this route and bring up the past of Hillary's spouse (Bill Clinton); then it's fair to bring up the issue of those nude photos (some pornographically o) of his spouse (Melania Trump). And Trump can't be allowed to get away with saying Bill Clinton was president and Melania Trump was not a politician, thus implying her past doesn't matter. That won't work; Melania expects to be our First Lady, just as Bill would now be our First Gentleman â€“ a checkered past is a checkered past! It's time to beat trump at his own game - even if it means bringing in any of his own past because Hillary has had only one spouse; therefore, she's never cheated on anybody whereas Trump has had 3 spouses, cheating on each of the first two to be with the other."

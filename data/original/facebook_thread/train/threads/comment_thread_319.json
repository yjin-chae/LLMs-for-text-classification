Then the the true smoke and mirrors began. A plagiarized speech, a lie about being a college graduate, and poof the trumps disappear back to their hotel room another audience taken. Where there's smoke there is fire and whenever a Trump is involved there is a liar"

Not remotely comparable to copy-pasting two paragraphs and shuffling a handful of words around like a lazy college student. Sad!"

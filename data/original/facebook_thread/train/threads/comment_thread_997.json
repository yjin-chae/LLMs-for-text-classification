    "text": "Mr Trump ( we will be so happy when it's President Trump) we love you and your family. I've got a confession to make I'm 55yrs old and never voted before this year. You are the reason why I'm voting. My girlfriend and I truly believe you will do everything you can for the American people. We thank you for giving yourself to this challenge of fixing the problems that the Clinton's and Obama have caused to our great nation. We all believe in you and will do all we can to help you in whatever way we can. Please make America great again. My God bless you and your family and keep you all safe. Thank you sir. You have our utmost respect."

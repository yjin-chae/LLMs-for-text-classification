      "text": "Dear Hillary Supporter, Did you miss the part where she lied to congress? You know that's called perjury…. Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical? How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that? How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that's Obstruction of Justice, right? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too? How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right? Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails? How about when she lied about being under sniper fire? Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too? What about that 'pay for play' with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That's kind of hard to miss, huh? Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know... Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying… You know she was labeled \"Extremely careless\" about national security by the FBI, right? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can't remember any briefings on how to handle classified material? Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn't remember 39 times? Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of 'I don't recall' 56 times? Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left? Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics? Don't you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts ! But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump? Oh no because she's the first woman to be elected to run for President? Well she's not the first woman to run for President. That was Victoria Claflin Woodhull, she was an American leader of the woman's suffrage movement. In 1872, Woodhull ran for President of the United States. Didn't know that huh? Why because you don't educate yourself... PS...She wasn't truly elected for the Democratic Party by the people...The DNC stole the nomination from Bernie. Ignorant people who live with their head in the sand...all I can do is pray for you to take your head out of the sand. Take a stand and help make America Great Again! Oh its great, you say? Okay, let's see you walk down the street in intercity of Chicago you can hold a Clinton/Kaine sign if you want! Let me know where you would like flowers sent!"

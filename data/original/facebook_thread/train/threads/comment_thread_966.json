      "text": "Clinton would go \"well beyond\" that lawby charging big banks a new risk fee, preventing them from making \"speculative gambles with taxpayer-backed deposits\" and toughening up enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission. The presumptive Democratic nominee, who collected $675,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs, may get substantial donations from Wall Street. But her campaign platform proves readiness to swim against the finance industry tide. Trump's platform proves exactly the opposite. His game of calling the rest of the world corrupt for behavior he engages in is, by now, both well understood and tired. Trump once said of the conservative Koch Brothers, \"I don't want their money or anything else from them\" ‚Äî but his campaign recently requested a meeting with Koch political aides. Trump once blasted billionaire Sheldon Adelson for trying to mold Marco Rubio \"into his perfect little puppet\"; he now calls it \"an incredible honor\" to win Adelson's $100 million-plus campaign spending commitment. Trump once called superPACs a \"very corrupt\" \"disaster\"; he now welcomes many multi-million-dollar superPACs into his money-hungry fold. Trump once said he is \"not using the lobbyists\" ‚Äî but a top Washington lobbyist, Paul Manafort, runs his campaign, and Trump is otherwise reaching out to the capital's infamous K Street. Ignore the salesman's pitch. Start looking at the product he's trying to sell."

His last financial statement also showed that his campaign hadspent hundreds of thousands of dollars at Trump properties and on hats. Trump's campaign has promised that he would convert over $45m, and on 23 June the candidate falsely claimed to have already done so."

      "text": "Not out of context! Trump said it! It would be out of context if adding \"nukes\" to it! This comment comes from a 90-minute speech in Iowa on Nov. 12, 2015. In the speech, Trump theorized that former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein feigned having weapons of mass destruction to scare neighboring Iran, before briefly sidetracking into his feelings on war generally. \"This is the Trump theory on war,\" he said. \"But I'm good at war. I've had a lot of wars of my own. I'm really good at war. I love war in a certain way. But only when we win.\""

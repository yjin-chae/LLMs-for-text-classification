    "text": "Great message.... Other than protect Obamacare????? How much do those celebrities, or Hillary pay in premiums and deductibles for Obama care? How much did they make on that commercial?? STOP race baiting and using scare tactics for votes. People who support other candidates are not racist and it disgusts me the division these accusations have caused this election. She needs a new campaign. That is why I started out liking her.....and changed my mind. Do people buy this?"

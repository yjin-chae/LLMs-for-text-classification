Then, when you call them on their darkness, their next trick is to try and confound you by re-wording and confusing you. But people of the light have been moving forward, growing and evolving all this time, while these dark trolls have remained stuck in the same ruts. That's why they don't have anything new to say. What an awful life. I'm glad and honored and grateful that I already VOTED EARLY for #ClintonKaine and voted BLUE all the way down the ballot!!!!!!!"

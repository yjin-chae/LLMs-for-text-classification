    "text": "I heard a mother this morning say she doesn't know how anyone could vote for Trump. I personally don't know how a mother could vote for someone who wants to have open borders to let terrorists and drug lords stream into our country. Isn't it a mother's duty to protect her children from harm? Maybe she should talk to a mother who's child has been a victim of a terrorist attack and ask herself if she would want' to have to endure the same. Someday she may have to explain to her children why she voted for someone who wants to open our borders to many who want to kill us. And that is just one of the many issues we should be concerned about. If Hillary is elected we will be setting our children up for a life of terror, debt, and corruption. I urge everyone to educate themselves on the real and important issues that will affect us and our children and not let themselves be fooled by Hillary and the media."

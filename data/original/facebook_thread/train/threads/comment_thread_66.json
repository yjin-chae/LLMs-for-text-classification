    "text": "Donald Trump talks a good patriotic spin of BS, but his own criminal misuse of falsified medical deferments to avoid serving his nation's call to serve, suggests he's not exactly the patriot he' s posturing as. That Trump used undocumented aliens and imported construction workers from south of that border to build his new hotel, should stand as a factual expression of how dishonest and duplicitous trump is."

Furthermore Hillary adamantly supported Barry Goldwater in his presidential campaign thank goodness he lost so how can Trump be considered a racist when Hillary Clinton has direct ties and associations with hatred segregation and racism"

      "text": "trolls seem to be pointing to HRC's friendship with Senator Robert Byrd as suspect. Byrd was a klan member in his youth, and like many so-called Dixiecrats, he was against the Civil Rights Act. It's the reason why so many southern Democrats left the party and became Republicans. Nixon courted them with his Southern Strategy. But by the time Byrd and Clinton became friends, he'd become a strong defender of civil rights, and called joining the klan the worst mistake of his life. He spent the rest of his life atoning for his youthful mistakes, supporting civil rights, and speaking out against racism. So see, racist Trump trolls - there's a chance for you yet! Maybe you'll realize the error of your ways!"

Democrats show idiots like David Duke as a Trump supporters. Paint Trump as racist. But thats ok. Trump has never been called racist until nbc and cnn and the ny times call him racist. Democrats love pulling the race card when they need it."

I get that. This election is focused more on negativity and I need to be more mature instead of getting all fired up over propaganda from both sides"

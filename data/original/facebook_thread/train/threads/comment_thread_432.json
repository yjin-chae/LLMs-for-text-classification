    "text": "Everyone is potentially under audit for at least three years after filing tax returns. That means every single resident and citizen of US and every single person who has run for president and released his/her tax returns could later be audited by IRS. So being under audit is a lame excuse. I'm sure there's a lot to learn from his personal tax returns as there was a lot to learn from his Foundation returns which by law have to be public. Even crooked Nixon released his tax returns. The fact that DT isn't releasing his returns speaks volumes."

He did give to Pam Bondi's campaign though from other people's money in his foundation in a clear pay-for-play scheme right around the time she dropped investigations against his fake university. Very generous indeed."

Did I mention the Clinton Foundation gives less than 10% to their causes, out of the trillions they receive? Oh, and the money she accepts from countries that hate America, like Saudi Arabia?"

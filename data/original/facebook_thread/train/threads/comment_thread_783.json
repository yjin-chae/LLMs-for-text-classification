    "text": "We already pay (with our taxes) for public colleges. Why should we pay twice? We spend so much money putting people in prison for drugs (non-violent offenders) that if we send people to college and get treatment instead of incarceration, we'd have more than enough money for both. Stop using money to ruin people and start building them up. It's two birds with one stone. (Three if you count how that philosophy would demilitarize and improve our law enforcement and criminal justice systems) everything is intertwined."

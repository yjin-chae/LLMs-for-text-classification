My hudband did not know whonthere daughter was, and he was guardig that hoise while it was being built. One day, he saw her on TV actually at the debate and said \"I know this girl. I saw her before.\" So, I said it is the Clinton's daughter and he said she was the one coming to the house. He even said hello, and he was not aware who she was because he is from Italy and has his test coming up for citizenship really soon! Going to celebrate at the Statue of Liberty."

      "text": "So typical of the left to criticize people who don't support their views. My Marine and Soldier are the reason why I don't support Hillary Clinton for president. Also by the way I voted for him twice. He is supposed to be the president for all the people not just you people on the left. I have never seen a president pander so much for a presidential candidate. So so if it makes me an idiot for stating my opinion then so be it."

      "text": "\" No Need to Worry, ISIS is a Second String JV Team .\" President Obama Was quoted as saying. 13 years of war. How many dead, how many suffer from PTSD. President Obama and Hillary Clinton pulled our troops out and declared, \" They have ended the war in the Middle East.\" Now we are back there again and in Syria. Yes, it was not President Obama who started this war, but it has been 8 years, and no resolve or bringing our troops home. President Obama and Mrs. Clinton promised us, NO MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. Now we have boots across the globe fighting ISIS. Eight Years and our Country is now in a bigger mess. Have you heard our President and Hillary Clinton address this in the Debates consistently. Have you heard them talk about Syria and our troops deployed there during every debate or campaign speech No. How about our Media ask them why we left Iraq defenseless when we left their country. How about asking who opened the door for ISIS to take control. No the Media will not ask Mrs. Clinton That Question consistently. Or why after 8 years we still have boots on the ground. We were promised NO MORE Boots on the ground. President Obama and Hillary Clinton and others, will not talk about it on a regular basis. We now again have over 10,000 troops there, and Troops in Syria fighting ISIS. How about the Media, Mrs Clinton and President Obama spend the next week discussing what we are doing for our Troops that have fought this war that need help with PTSD or the 275 Bodies of our Military that were dumped in a Mass Grave. Our Secretary of States says very little regarding the war in Mosul, and in Syria.The Media Forgot to ask our President, and our Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, how come they are sweeping this under the rug again by saying very little about our troops and the wars in Iraq and Syria. Yes we are still at war and they speak very little about it. Yes, we have Men and Women who served in these wars that need help when they return. Yes, we are at War with BOOTS ON THE GROUND. I guess it was not important enough to Hillary Clinton to focus on it in every debate, and on the Campaign Trail every day. And our Media choose not to include the right questions about the war in their Debate questions on a regular basis. Yes, our troops are fighting terrorism again, around the Globe. And Mrs. Clinton very seldom will focus on the WAR. She is too worried about her bleach bit computer, her lost emails that she said never existed, Her accusations that Benghazi was because of a Video. And the undisclosed millions upon millions that were funneled through her offices on a pay to play deal. And millions and millions of unaccounted for monies and arms that were used against our own United States Military. And the list goes on and on."

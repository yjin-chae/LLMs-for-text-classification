You can't lie about 33,000 emails, allow ISIS to spread, and call millions of hard-working Americans \"deplorables!\" I will bring BIG CHANGE on DAY ONE. #AmericaFirst! #NotHillary!"

As an independent Until I hear how you are going to bring change and all the details of how you will bring change you do not and will not get my vote"

We may be against each other in other elections but this election we as independents, Democrats and true Republicans must stand together against this man and his followers. It doesn't matter how we do it. Either vote for Gary Johnson or Hillary Clinton or even Jill Stein if you want, but we must stand together and get any other candidate other than trump into office no matter who that is."

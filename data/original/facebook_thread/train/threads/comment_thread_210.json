    "text": "YOU ACCEPT MONEY FROM FOREIGNERS, which is illegal, who support laws that stand by men who beat, rape and even stone their wives to death. I GUESS THESE BEHAVIORS ARE THE MORAL HIGH GROUND YOU SEEK....which has nothing to do with women's rights.......SO Y'ALL GO AHEAD AND VOTE FOR HILLARY.......MAYBE THE SWORDSMAN WILL VISIT YOU FIRST......after all...you are not a believer of ISLAM and are...by default...a legal target for them.......AND DON\"T WORRY about it being a long wait. Remember she said she wants 650,000 here in the first year of her presidency. AND YOU CALL THIS A SCARE TACTIC IF YOU WANT....REFER TO THE ISLAMIC CLERICS THEMSELVES IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME. Rape of a non-believer is even condoned by the women of ISLAM. Have a nice day....now.....and be American.....DON'T vote for Hillary."

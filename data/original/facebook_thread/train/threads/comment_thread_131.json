Im a strong woman its all an opinion. Now Hillary!! She let soldiers die on her clock! She wants to let everyone be a parasite off my dollar!! She has done nothing in 30 years! She left nafta happen!! Theres so much wrong that she has already done!! As far as im concerned with Trump talking about a woman is the same as what color curtain Hillary is wearing! I DONT CARE!!! Its petty crap!! I care about my country being safe and like Trump said Build a wall until we know who is coming in!!!"

Attempting to protect Crooked Hillary, NOT our American service members or national security information, is absolutely DISGRACEFUL. The American people deserve so much better. On November 8th, we will END this RIGGED system once and for all!"

Please stop allowing Hillary and her corrupt campaign to stop you from delivering your message to Make America Great Again! We know there is some voter fraud, the media is spinning everything you say on that topic. Get on with winning this race."

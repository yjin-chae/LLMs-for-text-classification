Mine from Finland & Slovania and they had to learn to speak english when they came here in the early 1920's. On both sides they volunteered in WWII. So Colleen, you are in great company of all Americans."

My family migrated to the US running away from communism in Nicaragua, and with the current situation, in politics and economy I see the US following the same foot steps of every socialist/communist country. God may Bless America the best choice for president in our country, and that is Mr. Donald Trump!"

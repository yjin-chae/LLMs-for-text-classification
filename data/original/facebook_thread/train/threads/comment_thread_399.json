    "text": "Hello, hope all is well, I have contributed a couple times with the promise of a hat, never got the 1st one, and then got another email saying contribute and get a free hat, so I did again, still not hat, I've emailed and never got a response. I thought fine typical politician say one thing do another. It has been several months since those donations so its been plenty of time, I just thought I wouldn't donate again if you are like all the other politicians, of course I have if you check your list but not as much as I'm out of work and struggling. But just wanted to let you know my disappointment with what seems as the same old same old, tell you whatever just to get your votes, will still vote for you but disappointed in how I've been taken so far. Anyway didn't know where else to write since never heard a word back from emails. Take care and God Bless."

If you paid by credit card you may be able to contact the card company, to trace where your payment went, and take appropriate action. Good luck in your plight."

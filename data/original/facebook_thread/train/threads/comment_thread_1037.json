      "text": "The scariest part of all this is not the just fact that TRUMP is a habitual liar, but the fact that he honestly has no concept of the definition of the word \"truth\". He has spent his whole life living in a bubble of privilege, that to him, a \"lie\" is simply anything that makes him look bad and the \"truth\" is whatever he says it is - even if that changes from minute to minute. This is what comes from never having been taught values, morals or ethics. Makes you wonder how he REALLY made all of his money. He is delusional and so are all o f his \"Cult of Trump\" followers. #CultOfTrump"

Is that another one of his \"successful business ventures\"? Or is he going to blame it all on a conspiracy against him? You know, if he was an effective businessman, he could have turned it around, right? Nah, he's just a LOSER!"

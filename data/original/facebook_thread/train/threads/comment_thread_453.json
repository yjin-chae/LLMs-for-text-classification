Justice and equality can win. Our history has moved in that directionâ€”slowly at times, but unmistakablyâ€”thanks to generations of Americans who refused to give up or back down.\" â€”Hillary"

    "text": "Tonight is quite a historic night for Hillary Clinton & the DNC, while she has become the 1st woman nominated by a major political party she is also the 1st woman to accomplish many more other things. She is the 1st woman to personally make millions from the richest foreign govts across the world in exchange for govt contracts, she is the 1st woman to make 145 million from 9 investors transferring 20% of all US Uranium to Putin's Russia, she is the 1st woman to make millions from undisclosed/sealed Wall Street speeches, she is the 1st woman nominated who is currently under FBI Investigation for public corruption & treason, she is the 1st woman to bypass federal law & use an illegal private server to conduct off the record business as Secretary of State, she is 1st woman to be SOS & leave our military personnel to die in Benghazi & lie about it to our soldiers' families faces, & she is the 1st woman to go on the record & say your 2nd amendment is not a Constitutional Right. This is the face of the Democratic Party now: crooked career politicians, globalist agendas, & outright corruption. You tell me what 8 more years of this will do to this country, if this country can even survive 8 more years. Good Luck Hillary, your gonna need ALOT of it. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸"

No the first woman to use a private email server as Sec Def is condolezza rice for sure (possibly Madelyn Albright), no she is not under FBI investigation for either corruption or treason, 2nd Bush lost people under his presidency for many reasons including embassy personnel, and she never said the 2nd amendment isn't a constitutional right. For that last part, all I have for proof is the vitriol and misinformation the Right spewed about Obama during his election season still hasn't come to pass. Still here, with a healthier economy, a stronger foreign presence, sans Osama."

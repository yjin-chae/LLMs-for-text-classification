    "text": "Donald Trump does not speak for me in fact he is the lowest form of a human. He WAS sued and lost for not renting to people of color. He is a racist and it's people that are also racist that follow this idiot if a man. You don't believe in equality, justice, or fair play, I fully understand why you were called deplorable. I've noticed since Trump started losing so bad the republicans remarks are getting nastier and more vulgar. When they open their mouth they prove they have no class! DONALD TRUMP IS LOSING!!!!! VOTE BLUE STRAIGHT DOWN! GO HILLARY2016!"

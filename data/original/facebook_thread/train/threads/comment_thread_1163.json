SO unbelievably corrupt. The system is rigged and as President, I promise you, I will end it! You will always be FIRSTâ€”not donors, not special interests, not Washington insidersâ€”you! #AmericaFirst!"

And guess what? They were going with or without NAFTA, and not Trump or anyone else can bring them back. I also gave myself an informal education on the world by working hard to send myself to 40+ countries across 5 continents solo, so my ideas on other countries and our place among them doesn't just come from my home town views, limited life experience and what I hear on TV. How about you? Love to hear about your education."

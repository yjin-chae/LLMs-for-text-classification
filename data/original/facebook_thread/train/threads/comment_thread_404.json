      "text": "Here's the latest from my RNC source as of the 29th. AB/EV Summary Report, 10/29 Florida Early voting started 5 days earlier this year in the majority of Florida counties and we are seeing great improvements over 2012: Republicans are outperforming our 2012 turnout by 7%, while Democrats are underperforming theirs by 10%. 2012 – Through the first five days of early voting, Democrats led Republicans by over 135,000 early votes, 506,000 to 641,000 (56% to 44%). 2016 – Through the first five days of early voting, Republicans are now only trailing by 38,000 early votes, 544,000 to 582,000 (42% to 39%). Pennsylvania Voter enthusiasm is way up in Republican-leaning rural counties throughout the state compared to 2012: In Somerset County, there have 285% more ballots cast to date, with Republicans leading 63% to 31%. In Cameron County, there have been 17% more ballots cast to date, with Republicans leading 59% to 33%. In Sullivan County, there have been 6% more ballots cast to date, with Republicans leading 56% to 36%. In Fulton County, there have been 4% more ballots cast to date, with Republicans leading 68% to 24%. Nevada In ten of Nevada's counties, including Clark and Washoe, Republicans are leading in absentee ballots returned by a total of over 1%, while Republicans trailed by 3% at this point in 2012. Republicans have cast over 7,000 more total ballots to-date than at this point in 2012. North Carolina Yesterday was by far Republicans' best day of early voting in 2016; over 79,000 early votes were cast. Republican turnout yesterday outperformed any single day in 2012. Because of Democrat voters' underperformance in early vote, Republicans trail by 35,000 fewer total ballots cast today than we did on this day in 2012. Ohio While voters in Ohio do not register by party, there have been some positive signs from counties that Romney carried in 2012: Butler County – Republicans have requested 12% more ballots to date than at this point in 2012. Miami County – Voters have exceeded 2012 requested ballot numbers to-date and have already returned 15% more ballots than they did at this point in 2012. Clermont, Licking, and Medina Counties – Republicans have requested between 8-10% more ballots to date than at this point in 2012, with Clermont also nearly matching their returned ballot rate as well (97%). In 7 Romney counties, voters have returned more ballots at this point in time than in 2012 (Miami, Ross, Marion, Shelby, Pike, Highland, Jackson)."

    "text": "\"Hillary is not somebody who fears divulging state secrets. She lied to the FBI about having multiple devices, sending and receiving confidential documents on multiple private servers. She believes that the future it is hers to shape. The same way it's always been. Hillary desires to control our destiny, as long as she can keep us divided. As long as we think of ourselves not as just a collection of individuals as the constitution states, but as a collection of devised groups, or a collection of controlled states, but as the United States of America under her rule. She doesn't understand that...our economy works best not when its not controlled by the government,but when everybody's got a fair shot at a truly free market.\" — Americans"

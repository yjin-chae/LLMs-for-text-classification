    "text": "Hillary Clinton's niece announced this week that she's all in — for Donald Trump — and that she cannot endorse her \"selfish\" aunt. \"I support Donald Trump 100 percent,\" Macy Smit, the daughter of Bill Clinton's half-brother Roger Clinton, told RadarOnline. \"I have been a Democrat my entire life, but Trump is what we need right now — somebody who is going to stand up for us. I think at this point Hillary just wants it for the history books — to be the first woman president for selfish reasons,\" the 25-year-old Tampa hairstylist continued. Smit said that she'd never met Clinton, partly because she believes that side of the family looks down on her. \"Something tells me the Clinton side looks at me and my mother as not good enough, but we're hard-working,\" Smit told RadarOnline Wednesday."

      "text": "We had a sign waiving event in Tulsa today. The support was overwhelmingly for Trump. Folks smiling, waiving and honking. Easily two thirds responded positively. About one out of ten were negatove. None were just a little negative. Her supporters were vile, hate spewing, flawed monsters and they made themselves look silly. We laughed and laughed. I do not want to be a part of her America. It is a very dark place based on lies and thievery. I am voting for Trump and so is the vast majority of America. Yay!"

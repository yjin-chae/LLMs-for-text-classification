      "text": "Hillary, I was hoping for a REAL foreign policy speech from you focused on how YOU would deal with foreign issues, not focused on why you \"THINK\" Donald Trump cannot handle foreign policy. And we don't have to \"THINK\" about how you would handle foreign policy, because your record speaks for itself â€“ Failed war in Libya which launched the country into chaos and created a welcome mat for terrorist, not protecting our embassy people in Benghazi, abandoning our solders in battle, never mentioning radical Islam, nor a plan to protect our borders against terrorist, as well as putting the nation's security at risk with your private email and server scandal. Your record on foreign policy has been a record of failure after failure. You should never again be granted a top-level security clearance, let alone be given nuclear codes. #NEVERHILLARY"

She was doing her job by representing this man (who specifically asked for a woman to defend him, otherwise she wouldn't have been the one to do it) and she didn't want to take the job in the first place. Also BILL CLINTON IS NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT."

Matthew 14 Trump has a hearing date of December 16th on a charge of raping a 13 year old. What a terrific example he is for our youth."

I have been promoting our beautiful Hillary Clinton in the state of Utah..I believe she will continue with the progress we have made against many social and economical issues. I do admire that Bernie got so many young people together, that was pretty impressive. I really think he should be our vice president. He should get out and support Hillary Clinton...The glass ceiling gap is cracking down ..yeah..go Hillary! #IMIN"

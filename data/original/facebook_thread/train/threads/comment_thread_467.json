Tired of hearing how he doesn't have a woman's vote. I personally don't give a rats butt what he says that may be controversial. Last time I checked it was actions that spoke louder. Like the worthless and dangerous actions of the Clinton's! #teamtrump"

      "text": "OK...still not sure what your point is. Not sure why you would call me miss house keeping either. I'm guessing being the small minded person that you are figured that I was Hispanic. Let me guess you rather support a liar and a corrupt politician that has done absolutely nothing for this country. And you probably l demoralize a man that wants to take this country back from people that shouldn't even be here in the first place. You probably also judge a person based on whether they pay their taxes as well just like the millions of illegal immigrants that pay their taxes right? My family and I came to this country and got an education as well as a citizenship the right way. We have payed our dues and I am still paying mine. A proud American and I love this country too much to see it keep getting destroyed by corrupt politicians and liberals that love living off of the government while the rest of us hard working, business owning people pay their bills. ðŸ’¯âœŒðŸ‘Œ"

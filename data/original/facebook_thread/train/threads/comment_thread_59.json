    "text": "Unity at the DNC equals boring. We can already predict what will be said...dumping on Trump and the Republicans, how much \"free stuff\" we can give everyone, and how the Democrats will fight for women's rights. Boring. It might be more interesting if Hillary is asked to explain her 30 plus years of lying, why women's rights is only about abortion, and why women executives at the Clinton Foundation earn significantly less than their male counterparts. Now that would make for an exciting convention."

      "text": "Or asking her why she said to the world \"we have 4 dead Americans, at this point what does it matter\". Or why she accepted millions from Islamic countries that violate human rights. These kind of things are why she can't hold an open press conference. With gods help she will be faced with these questions at the debates, and maybe she will call Mrs.Smith a lier about why she was told her that her son died over a video. She said once that \" some people are going to have a Lot to answer for\" . Well Hillary why won't you answer for yours."

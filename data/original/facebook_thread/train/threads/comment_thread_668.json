We stand for justice against the corruption, the lies, and the division of American citizens! All corrupt, career politicians must go! Nationalism not globalism! Trump/Pence 2016 Voting for Hillary is voting for civil war. The majority of Americans are fed up with government control and oppression. Tired of them trying to divide us by any means possible to succeed at their corrupt agenda. There is corruption on both sides and at every level. We are sick of being sold to foreign governments and elites for profit. If hillary cheats her way to a win the majority will not take it lying down."

So, you can't say to me HILLARY SUPPORTER when you don't know me"

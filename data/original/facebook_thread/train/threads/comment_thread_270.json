I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.  Anyone who knows me, know these words don't reflect who I am.\n\nI said it, it was wrong, and I apologize.\n\nI've travelled the country talking about change for America. But my travels have also changed me.  I've spent time with grieving mothers who've lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I've been humbled by the faith they've placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down.\nLet's be honest.  We're living in the real world.  This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today.  We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were 8 years ago and Washington is broken.\nHillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground.\n\nI've said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days.\n\nSee you at the debate on Sunday."

I am barely getting all the info, but listening to more. Megyn Kelly knew of this I guarantee you. It has been plotted by Clinton. Megyn said days ago they were gonna come up with a surprise she bet! What I am gleaning from this is... We have a Country to save. We have had far worse running our Country than this. \"I am worried about what killary has done more than I am about what Trump has said.\" This tape is not only of Donald and his mouth, it is about Bushy boy edging it on! Am I happy? No, but I am not devastated by it either. If you are without sin, cast the first stone, but murdering is different. killary: There is one that shows NO sign towards the Almighty, her name is killary. She knows she is doing wrong, but still doeth evil. She actually has steadily progressed into great evilness with no hesitation! As a matter of fact, Bill has been to Pentecostal churches knowing of the Holy Ghost experience, so no excuse not knowing. She has proven she's never been willing to change her ways. We have seen one evil deed after evil deed time and time again. She thinks she is unstoppable. I believe she just sold out her soul to satan many years ago to do America in. She has no real love for America. Then you have someone that knows he is a sinner, Trump, but is showing more willingness to try Jesus out. He has slowly tried to work away from his wicked ways with his carnal ways. You can see how he has tried to clean it up year by year. He has gradually made positive steps toward a cleaner life in his own way. So here it is... ❗️killary has done everything she could to continue doing evil works after evil deeds with no remorse or reversal. She actually ☠MURDERS☠ people that get in her way. She has lied, cheated, hidden, stolen, deceived, lied, murdered her way up. Thinking always she will trick us into placing herself as our leader. Hiding all her secrets. She's found ways to hide all her evil for now without recourse, but her day is coming❗️ Trump has been raw, unfiltered, and to a fault too human, as a candidate with past problems that followed him. All he has to remember is keep his heart towards Jesus. Strive to be better every day. Keep America first. Don't lose hope. Ask for forgiveness of God. He can take what's wrong and make it right. Without Jesus the mind, heart and soul are susceptible to doing evil. With Jesus though you are made whole again. A Spiritual way for your soul will lead you the right direction. P.S. At least you don't kill people. Still love you TRUMP! I believe you have the love for us and our Country, killary never has had. She is all about power and money! Be praying for you! It will okay. We love you❗️I refuse to let her win. Keep pushing Trump. Look what all she has done, but still running."

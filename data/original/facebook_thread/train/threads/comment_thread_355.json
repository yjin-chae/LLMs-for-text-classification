    "text": "I've followed Trump from the beginning and he's literally turned the government into everything they criticized him for, Obama told people today to vote for a candidate under investigation from the FBI, he's been right so many times I lost count, the way He exposed the media, he reduced Jeb Bush to having to ask for applause, Cruz and Kasich combined like transformers in desperation, he told you the media was for Hillary and now CNN has been proven to have leaked her information, she said Trump didn't have the temperament to be president but today she was reduced to vulgar language at her rally, there's more people waiting to use a bathroom at a Trump rally than in her audience, he tells you daily how to fix the economy with NAFTA and tax cuts, the media and government literally begged him for specifics but no one on fox or CNN will explain the 400% trade deficit, the # 1 issue for everyone was the economy and the media never covers this aspect of Trump even though my TV is now Trump TV, Republicans bailed on him like the Titanic for mere words, but no one still has asked Hillary to step down, she lost 6 billion and uses a foundation as a Ponzi scheme, he's spent the least amount of money to have the most successful campaign in history breaking every record, the people chastising his economic plans don't tell you their models are based on skewed numbers and fraud, he's beaten, humiliated and exposed the establishment government of the United States and its media, yeah that guy couldn't be a great leader, you need to wake up America, Trump 2016"

      "text": "Hey! Trump finally got a newspaper endorsement!! The official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan voiced its support for Donald Trump today, adding to the already lengthy list of white nationalist groups who have cheered the Republican presidential nominee. The KKK quarterly The Crusader (\"The Premier Voice Of The White Resistance\") devoted its latest front page to a throaty defense of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2016/11/kkk-official-newspaper-support-donald-trump"

    "text": "Today I bought insurance, $350/mo for a silver plan, it's $4200 annual! It was not long ago that the same coverage cost me $80, I'm talking about 2010-2011. It's unbeleavable! And if you are not satisfied with your insurance you can't change it, you can't even uograde or downgrade your plan! That's clear monopoly for insurance companies. OBAMACARE must be repelled!"

I have lupus since I was a teenager and I have cancer that was proven to be caused from my lupus. I fully understand what you are living with. Sorry you are going through this also the only thing i hope is the insurance gets better then now !!!! And i believe that Donald J. Trump will make america great How about a way to allow non-custodial parents to deduct the same expenses. They pay childcare and child support and yet get zero tax allowances for that money paid. I really don't know if this plan is going to save money for most people or not.. but what I like to point out at. Is he never say anything about Killary or attacks her like she does on all her commercials.. #trump2016 your plan is flawed Mr. Trump. The numbers do not favor anyone but wealthiest families who actually pay thousands of dollars a month in child care. SOMETHING has to be done for those of us who lose jobs w no pay too take care of our elderly parent/parents its a TERRIBLE system!! Medicare pays for not much anymore :("

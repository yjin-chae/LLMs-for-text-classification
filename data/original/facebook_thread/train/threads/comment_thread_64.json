      "text": "Because if you support Bernie Sanders then presumably you agree with his ideals and Hillary is the candidate left who most closely matches them. She also wants expanded healthcare, to raise the minimum wage, to stand up for LGBT rights, to stand up for Women's Rights, to stand up for voting rights (that voter suppression happening in Arizona that so many Berners wanted to blame on her? She had a lawsuit already in place that Bernie joined, that was GOP doing), she wants to work towards green energy to combat climate change (Trump thinks it's a hoax), she supports common sense gun control, I could go on. And I know you don't want to hear to vote against Trump, but just imagine for a moment the future legacy he would leave via at least one if not 2-4 Supreme Court nominations, not even mentioning the rest of the chaos he would throw this country into."

    "text": "I was 16, working at a car wash in DC. 1997 Mrs. Clinton showed to have her BMW washed that day as she stated to my boss Gary, she had an important brunch meeting with a current senator at the time. Senator of Va. I over heard her say. Gary told her no problem Mrs. Clinton we'll have her ready in no time. Gary called my friend Jamal and I over to the car, I didnt have a license yet so Jamal would drive the cars around and we would detail them. As we approached Mrs. Clinton and her car she turned to Gary and said \"NO. I will not allow a Monkey Jigaboo to touch my car\".. Gary side eye'd her with a very distinct look. Though he never responded to the comment he adv dereck to move the car around and as I walked away Mrs. Clinton then slapped my butt and said \"Make it shine, cutie\". I felt violated. And I told my guardian and they did nothing. But I am here to tell you now. She is a Snake, the antichrist and NOT the womens she claims. And yes everything I have stated is 100% FACT. This copied comment came from a man who used to work at a car wash in DC in 1997."

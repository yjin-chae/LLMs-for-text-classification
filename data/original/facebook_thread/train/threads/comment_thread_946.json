    "text": "Wow, look at all the Trump Trolls here. It's amazing to me that they can be so convinced of the truth of information supplied by a man who can hardly open his mouth without lying or at the very least distorting the truth. It's like someone in an abusive relationship thinking the abuse(lying) will stop once they get married(elected). Keep in mind, everything bad you've heard about Hillary is second hand. All you had to do is watch the debates to know Trump's lies firsthand."

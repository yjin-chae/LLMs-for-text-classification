    "text": "Tough talking Trump avoided the draft for temporary \"heel spurs\" just as he stepped out a military academy only to become an allstar athlete in football, tennis and squash. Now he has the audacity to disparage those who answered the call to duty including John McCain and his years of service, torture and imprisonment. Is this the kind of coward and A-hole for president? Trump's 88 military personnel endorsements amount to less than 17% of the 500 + that penned an open letter supporting Romney. None of the signatories was a service chief or led a major combatant command."

    "text": "HOORAY FOR HILLARY! LOVE TRUMPS HATE. Besides Hillary's experience, platform, and policies, her toughness, her tenacity, and her heart - I'm voting for Hillary out of respect for my sisters, my wife, my mother, and all the intelligent, capable women I've had the privilege of knowing, working with, and working for. How can I vote for Trump knowing how he views them and all women? How can I vote for Trump as a president, when he thinks that way about more than half of the citizens of the USA? America never stopped being great. Trump's fear mongering, racism, bigotry, isolationism, and hate are NOT the path to a greater America. We need unity, not division, love not hate, tolerance not bigotry, and courage not fear. Love trumps hate. America became strong, and is strong, because we learned we're Stronger Together. As you've said, America is great because America is good. Hillary - I'm with you because you're for us. Peace, love, hope, unity - Hillary 2016"

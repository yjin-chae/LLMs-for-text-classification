    "text": "\"When Hillary was young, her mom taught her the Methodist Creed:  Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as you ever can. That's her North Star. That's what guides her. She believes in that. She believes we can summon what's best in each of us and make this country better for all of us.  \n\nThat's what America is about. We are a country like no other not because of the size of our skyscrapers or the power of our armies, but because we are a place founded for the sake of an idea. 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.' We don't have to be born into wealth or privilege in this country. We don't have to practice a certain faith. We don't have to have a certain last name. We just have to be willing to contribute. We just have to be willing to put our shoulder to the wheel of history, and we can be a part of this community that we call America.  \n\nThat's what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny. That's what led GIs to liberate a continent. That's what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot. That's what gave marchers the courage to cross a bridge in Selma. That's what allowed workers to organize for collective bargaining and better wages. That's what made America exceptional. That's what makes America great.  \n\nIn other words, America depends on you—you, all of you. America has never been about what one person says he'll do for us. I didn't say 'Yes, I can.' I said, 'Yes, we can.' It's about what can be achieved by us, each of us, together, through that hard, slow, and, yes, sometimes frustrating work of self-government. That means all of us.\" —President Obama"

How is JayZ shoving a little girl away by the face part of your women's rights initiative?"

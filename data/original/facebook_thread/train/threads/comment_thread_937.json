    "text": "I am a lifelong democrat and I will never be proud to say she is our President. I did not vote for her, my mother did not vote for her and my father did not vote for her. It's such a shame the democrats have lost their way. I used to refer to myself as a dyed-in-the-wool democrat but not anymore. The democrats are total hypocrites now and an embarrassment to our country, both Hillary and Trump."

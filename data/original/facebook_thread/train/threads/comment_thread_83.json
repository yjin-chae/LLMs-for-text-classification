You all just focus on his tax returns,his ego and what he has done in the past. You just feed the love everyone has for him. If he doesn't win,then Crooked Hillary and the crooked Democrats win. I know there is Gary Johnson and Jill Stein,but they'll need some catching up to even bear the surface of the general election. Sp Trump is our best shot of turning America back in the right direction. If he loses,then we'll just be lost forever."

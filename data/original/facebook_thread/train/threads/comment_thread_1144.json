    "text": "I deduce that by their religious background/conviction or partisan reasoning they'd not normally support abortion, but they'd of course not want their wives and one of their female family members conceive a baby from unwanted pregnancy, so the only difference i, i mean we could discern is partisan difference in their view on PP, whether or what stake they prioritize over women's right to ab. I don't believe PP willfully disregard the value of every human lives."

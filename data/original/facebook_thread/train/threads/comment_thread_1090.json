You give such bad example of superiority, discrimination etc. I do want the wall for security but I think your approach on saying MÃ©xico will pay for the wall..... when you can be more proper and neighborly and say \" we will build a wall together to protect our borders and neighbors etc. \" Instead you keep on being an AH so sad, you could have had most of the Mexicans vote."

Ridiculous charges against a real estate, investment \"advice\" course. Real estate investments are not for the faint of heart, nor for the untalented investors."

      "text": "I'm a veteran who served under the Clinton's when Bill was president. I had several friends that were stationed in DC as honor guard who constantly told me how terrible Hillary treated them as well as the White House staff. Hillary Clinton lied about landing under fire when she visited Tuzla, Bosnia, in March 1996. \"I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.\" Immediately after the speech that day, a reporter asked Clinton about remarks from others on the trip who suggested the trip was for photo opportunities rather than foreign policy and she stood by her account of sniper fire. \"There was no greeting ceremony, and we basically were told to run to our cars. Now, that is what happened,\" she said. Hillary Clinton retracted the remarks a week later, telling the Philadelphia Daily News editorial board on March 24, 2008, that she \"misspoke,\" correcting herself to say she had been told there was a threat of sniper fire in the area. The next day she told reporters, \"So I made a mistake. That happens. It shows I'm human, which for some people is a revelation.\" Videos clearly show Hillary Clinton arriving on the tarmac under no visible duress, and greeting a child who offers her a copy of a poem. Then she received flowers and took photos with several of the Bosnian children brought in there just for the photo ops with her.---- Mistake? How in the wold can you mistake receiving a poem, flowers and taking photos with the people and children of Bosnia as landing under the threat of sniper fire and having to be rushed to vehicles with your head down? -- Hillary Clinton will say anything to make herself look good for votes but she only cares for herself and represents nobody. This veteran will be voting for Mr. Donald J. Trump. #Trump2016 #VeteransForTrump #AmericaFirst"

I am a Healthcare provider and I take care of lots of vets so I can say that dealing with the VA is in fact always a nightmare of red tape... This would be Huge for your sister... And God Bless her and please thank her for her service."

She hit one of them in the back of the head when he was driving. Screamed at others and treated them like they were baggage handlers. They even taught Chelsea to refer to them as \"pigs\"."

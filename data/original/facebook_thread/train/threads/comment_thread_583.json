    "text": "Hillary is a monster who defended a rapist along with her sexual deviant husband and destroyed his female victims.....and she claims to be pro woman.... Oh and to top it off she compares herself to Abraham Lincoln!!! üòÇ, but trump says bad words ahahahaha. And for thoes that say \" bills not running for president\" This is why it's relevant. It's about the woman who IS running defending bill and destroying his victims to protect her political career and future while claiming to be pro woman. That's why BILL is the topic!!! Can you wrap your mind around that? And let's not even get into benghazi or 4 dead Americans or the 30k emails deleted and phones smashed by her interns or them taking the 5th in court... OR the crushing amount of wikileaks emails that seem to come out daily exposing who she REALLY is.... it really is just overwhelming why not only is she not in jail...but running for office Can you feel it Hillary? You must see it...the whole world knows what you are now.... you can hide behind your media and small number of people in power but the whole of the American people see you now. You must see and feel what is happening...look at your own Facebook page..most of the popular comments and likes are from people who reject you...you must pay people to show up to your rallys you can barely fill... can you not accept you are not wanted? Or is your agenda and masters who own you..the people who bought you...is their agenda what matters? The things that are \"normal\" and \"common\" things democrats get caught doing would be career ending and criminal for republicans to do.... Hillary obama and her democrats must be held accountable... I mean just look at the new undercover video by project veritas (youtube search \"rigging the election)....voter fraud...paying protestors (including homless and mentally ill) people to incite violence at trump rallys to paint trump supporters as violent.... admitting to busing in people to illegally vote... All from DNC stagers (now fired which shows admittance of guilt) directly under hillarys command.... Your time of being above the law is coming to an end. Sincerely The Deplorables"

      "text": "Lmao trump has over 53 open criminal cases from tax evasion, fraudulent businesses, and the rape of a little girl just to name a few. Yes she defended a rapist as a public defender. She tried to have herself removed from his case but the court denied the request. Maybe your too stupid to understand that public servants don't choose their clients the government does. If she would refuse, she would have been disbarred. You claim all these criminal acts yet millions of dollars wasted trying to find something and they found nothing. Even one of the investigators admitted to falsifying information in order to prosecute. As for wikileaks they have already gotten caught falsifying emails. So why would we believe anything they say. Lmao alot of mute points on your end, but good luck trying to spin this. Chances are you will just insult instead of discuss because thats the trump supporter way."

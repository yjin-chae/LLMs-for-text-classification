    "text": "Yeah, millions of liberal women had to put down their copy of 50 Shades of Grey to complain on the internet about how Trump talked about some women. Millions of liberal men had to pause PornHub to complain on the internet about how Trump treats women. The old guard still hasn't figured out that liberals are not our country's religious order that gets to define rules and shame people who break them. Stop trying to appease liberals. Even if Jesus Christ himself ran they'd find a reason why you're not a true Christian if you vote for him. Probably involving that incident attacking their favorite government employees: tax collectors."

      "text": "Lucas, democrats are not playing on their followers' emotions their followers, Black Americans are simply comfortable in that party. The opposite one has never attracted them.People who are interested in history know that your party is for Whites and whoever is in the opposite group feel comfortable and at home in the Democratic party. They dont' need to be rewarded in being there, they share the same ideology and are happy to be members of the same family. Of course, your candidate is eager to win and feels that, humiliating Blacks with insults and diminishing their self-esteem is the way to proceed. Indeed, a lot of inconscious brothers who are short sighted and bribed are running blindly to follow him! He's going to give them jobs and eternal happiness! How can you be so credulous? knowing all the lies and the change of mind and language we have been witnessing? Good luck! There are a lot of jobs in Trump Towers, Trump everything and everybody will be rich ! \"America will be great again\"!"

What I am interested in this campaign, guided with our First Amendement, is to express our view for the facts that deserve to be debated! And I am desappointed with your attitude of exhibitin knowledge on history of Abraham Lincoln, a Republican who abolished Slavery every body knows it! this wasn't the point of our discussion. about.. In my opinion, I am supporting Hillary and you are supporting Mr. Trump and we are trying to prove the sincerity of the issues. I notice your deviation of the facts, when speaking about KKK inclusion in the campaign, you went to cite Robert Byrd who were once Democrat, and is know Ret. and you avoided to speak about David Duke,a Republican, former KKK, whom Hillary alluded as being in the basket of \"deplorables\". Now, you are treating Black American of being slaves of the Democratic party, and Trump needs to take them out of the Democratic Party You did not blame the rhetoric that you candidate used to appeal them. O.K., we are used of his insults : Poor, jobless, not schooled, leaving in horrible neighboorhoods, etc. Everybody heard that! ? Of course, you did not condemn the pitch of his tone! For you, he's trying to releave Black Americans from the Slavery of being in a Democratic party. Your candidate is a pathological not only a liar, but a racist. His slogans as: \"We have to take our Country back\", or \"we are going to make America Great again\", or the Birtheurism are all racist!"

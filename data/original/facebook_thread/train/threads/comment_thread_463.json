    "text": "Many people love dictators because dictators love to silent others who challenge their authority and their view of their world. Dictators and their followers believe that they have the right and are entilled to say and want and what they please, just so they can continue to make themselves look great. However, they are also lonely insecure individuals who need to force themselves onto others and belittle and demean rather than explain and listen. However it say s more about the USA being usurped after decades of dictating their values onto others in the world. It is a pity that the power vacuum we have on this earth will not change no matter who gets elected. Donald will certainly not change, remember he didn't pay any tax, which means he couldn't give a crap about the country and the people. Only in it for himself, however isn't that the values that the US inspire to be, the individual is greater than the common good. That is why you have the crap health system you have where corporations make the money whilst the sick and ill go without, they have the highest rate of death by guns, higher rates of poverty than many 3rd world nations. This is not new, this has been going on for decades, yet Trump wants to make USA great again, great like when? I hope the Canadians build a wall, actually why not build a wall around the whole of the USA and keep all the looneys in one place. Oh, if you build a wall, US citizens can't leave either, can't have it both ways folks other wise Mexico will turn into another Cabo San Lucas, fake fake fake."

OMG please can this election end so we can stop listening and hearing from him. Running a business and running a country are two different entities. Tony Abbott would love him."

    "text": "It is terrible to see that that Kelsi Trump made it this far. He has 2 point that he talks about and the rest is mumbo jumbo garbage. He is incompetent, incapable and inconsistent to be president of the United States. So far he has not answered in question asked of him. He wants tax cuts for the wealthy, we'll they did that before and the top 400 wealthy people net worth went from roughly 800 billion to 500 trillion because they kept the profits and it didn't trickle down. I'm so disappointed that out of all the Republicans that entered the race Trump is on stage. Don't get Trumpped by Trump."

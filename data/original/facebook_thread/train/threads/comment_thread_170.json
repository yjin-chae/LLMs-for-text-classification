    "text": "A note from Hillary for America Campaign Manager Robby Mook. If you're with Hillary, donate now: hrc.io/2ec2HcJ\n\n\"As of this morning, the Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll has us down one point. As of yesterday, Trump's odds of winning had climbed to above 1-in-4, per Nate Silver's projections. And he seems to be making up ground in Florida, according to a whole slew of polls. The truth is that Trump has a real, viable path to 270 electoral votes.\n\nWe have a very small window of time left to try to deploy resources to our battleground states that it will take to guarantee a win. So I'm asking you: Can you be one of the people we need on Facebook to step up and chip in to our GOTV Fund today to try to make sure we prove this poll an outlier come Tuesday?\n\nThis is the most consequential election in our lifetimes. Even a dollar today shows that you're fighting for Hillary: hrc.io/2ec2HcJ\n\nThanks,\nRobby\""

I'm embarrassed for our country and our candidates! We have so much more to be worried about -like terrorism, homelessness, health insurance issues, education, etc. than what candidates have said in the past! I'm so frustrated I am ashamed to vote! We don't need another Clinton in office!"

      "text": "SHE BELONGS IN JAIL.........For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:\"(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term \"office\" does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.\" Yes, it explicitly states \"shall forfeit his/her office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.\" So, yes, it really is that simple. Hillary is \"disqualified from holding any office under the United States.\" So the only question left really should be to Mr. Trey Gowdy, who in our government is not afraid of her and going to step-up and follow the rule of the law and secondly, who is going to replace her on the Democratic ticket? Let's see in the upcoming days how many of those \"tough talking\" politicians will finally back up what they've been saying to the American people all this time and put Hillary Clinton in jail."

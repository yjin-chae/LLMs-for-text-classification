    "text": "Secretary of Defense Message LGBT Pride Month Message As written by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, June 07, 2016 This month is Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, an occasion that brings the LGBT community together with their family, friends, and allies to take pride in themselves and their many achievements. The Department of Defense recognizes Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender servicemembers and civilians for their dedicated service to the Department and the nation. Throughout our history, brave LGBT soldiers, sailors, airmen, Coast Guardsmen, and Marines have served and fought for our nation. Their readiness and willingness to serve has made our military stronger and our nation safer. We continue to take great pride in all that these men and women contribute to the Department and our mission. Their hard work, courage, and sacrifices make them respected members of our diverse DoD family. Through their service these Americans help ensure that we as a force embody the values we're sworn to uphold. And that our republic, born from the idea that all are created equal, endowed with unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, will remain strong and secure. These words are more than a pinnacle to strive for, they are principles we must promote every day. As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month together, let us take pride in all who step forward to serve our country. All who answer the call to service are doing the noblest thing they can do with their lives: to provide the security for others so they can dream their dreams, raise their children, and live full lives."

    "text": "Mr.Trump, I was disappointed with the massive audience of Olympic coverage, that you didn't run several Trump ads. It is vital that you stay focused on critical issues like improving employment, lowering the corporate tax rate & streamlining the burdensome regulations, national security & rebuilding our military strength. Please don't be distracted with liberal name-calling & efforts to confuse the low information voter. Thanks, Eric"

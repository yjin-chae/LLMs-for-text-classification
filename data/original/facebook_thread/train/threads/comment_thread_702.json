    "text": "Here is my statement.\n\nI've never said I'm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I'm not.  I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.  Anyone who knows me, know these words don't reflect who I am.\n\nI said it, it was wrong, and I apologize.\n\nI've travelled the country talking about change for America. But my travels have also changed me.  I've spent time with grieving mothers who've lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I've been humbled by the faith they've placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down.\nLet's be honest.  We're living in the real world.  This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today.  We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were 8 years ago and Washington is broken.\nHillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground.\n\nI've said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days.\n\nSee you at the debate on Sunday."

If you really think you will get lower taxes, perhaps Trump should have responded with the fact he (allegedly) worked within the system but will change the tax laws so the rich pay more. Instead he said he was smarter than the rest of us. It's also a bit Pollyanna- ish to think a man who has demeaned women his whole life, not just 11 years ago, will ever change. Go ahead and dislike Hillary if that's how you feel, but please don't fall into the hype that this man will ever respect women - even the three he married and cheated on. Those things don't happen in the real world.Jessica A"

I still truly believe both Obama and Hillary (and her husband) are all corrupt and her being the President worries me more. I am not happy with Trump, believe me when I tell you."

      "text": "i think a lot of the Clinton corruption reports are manufactured although I certainly don't believe she is lily white. And using that expression I do feel a lot of the Obama hatred is because of the opposite of lily white. There seems to be a lot more hatred being spewed this time around who believe our country is in dire straits. But i'm not convinced all is lost and we need the likes of Donald Trump to put us on the right track. At least with Hillary there will be a semblance of status quo where we may just have a chance by voting in the proper congress people. With Trump, he's a loose cannon. I do not believe for a nano second he will change the way he treats women and anyone who isn't a white Anglo Saxon - which I'm not - the Anglo part. There's a line from the play Annie Oakley that says \"I didn't know the gun was loaded...and I'll never ever do it again\". Right!!!"

That guy Billy Bush was no better encouraging him by laughing. He was bragging about his \"manhood\". This is a development I did not expect even though it is not totally surprising. The other phrase is a tiger does not change his stripes."

Playing solitaire and slots on my IPad, no money involved, and occasionally checking FB. Don is watching his taped Voice recordings. Oops, he just switched to college football. No news. No stress. No worries. Chicken wings cooking for dinner. If we put the tv on later, it will be the weather channel ðŸ˜Š."

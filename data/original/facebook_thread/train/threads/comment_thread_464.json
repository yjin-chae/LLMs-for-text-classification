Here's a hint, LBJ wasn't liked either so this was a last ditch \"effort\" to get him elected. He drug Vietnam on and was a scum sucking racist, but yay he was for socialism for \"votes\", so that makes it alright. Smh..."

I don't care when, where, or why the ad was made, the issue is what Trump has said in regards to nukes. He is completely ignorant of the ramifications of actions that would alter the world. No thanks."

World leaders do not look up to her, there's no way they can, not anymore and they are tired of the \"games\" that have been played and the carnage they have caused. The Chinese didn't leave Obama on the tarmac by accident at the G20. Trump can draw intelligence and wisdom from others in our government and will \"listen\" to what is best for us, not what is best for western global banks and their and her own pocket like Hillary does. Wow, Stalin and Lenin would be so proud of you."

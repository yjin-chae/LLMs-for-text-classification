    "text": "Your the problem Hillary! As President, Trump will welcome children like Omran and his family to live, play; as soon as Americas greatest minds come together under the Trump administration to execute comprehensive vetting reform, ensuring that America is only allowing humans who have no desire to wish or do America harm. Unfortunately we currently do not have successful vetting policy in place, by admission of our leaders. I highly doubt ISISL (ISIS)was \"joking\" when they announced their plan to infiltrate America's refugee flow with Jihadists. I feel horrible for this child, and Aylan Kurdi, and his mother & brother who died trying to escape a horrible inhumane situation. However, I will place blame where blame is due. And that is at the feet of Hillary Clinton blatant mishandling as Secretary of State and Obama's incompetence to recognize, address, or rectify her atrocious policies allowing for complete destabilization of the middle East. Specifically Syria and Libya #combatveterans4Trump Everyone that is voting Trump needs to wear red on election day. The people can expose the fraud and the liberal media won't be able to deny what their own cameras record at the polls. Spread the word. #TrumpRedOut"

      "text": "My friend - I feel as bad as you about Omran and families like that. I've personally been donating to foundations who support aids to Syria. Hillary wants to bring more of them to the State. Donald is against it. He's been against it since the beginning and his campaign was built on it. Yes, he brought the concept of \"Extreme vetting.\" I'm not against any good policies. But unfortunately, he didn't explain what it means. He mentioned, immigrants who share \"American values\" and countries like Syria and Iran will be affected. Below is one article. I would love to find one that explains this policy in details. But honestly, right now, a kid like Omran has a higher chance of getting into the U.S if Hillary is a president. (And believe me - I'm not a Hillary fan, nor Donald fan for that matter). http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-extreme-vetting-20160816-snap-htmlstory.html"

      "text": "What is happening in Syria is astounding Riley . I feel horrible for the families living in the devastation that comes from civil war. I applaud the day America starts welcoming these families. However, I'm also aware of the multiple horrendous attacks Radical Islamist have executed across Europe. European countries are the unfortunate example of poor vetting policies and I believe Hillary turns a Blind eye to a majority of these facts and would in the long run endanger the national security of America and put everyday citizens at risk. Although I can't tell you Trump's vetting plan details. I can say that I'm happy he's willing to attempt to take a step in the right direction instead of ignoring it. More than that I believe it is not just America who should accept refugees. Why have the five richest Muslim countries in middle East not taken in refugees? They say it is for security reasons. I believe the smartest minds internationally should attempt to find a vetting solution and place these refugees in all nations including Egypt and Sadi Arabia"

    "text": "Allegedly, Don't let the power of distraction become the lever of attraction. But you have to admit there is such a looming question at hand. Why would an attractive, young Muslim girl marry a Weiner? Was she attracted by his perversions? Or perhaps his desire to be an exhibitionist. They say, you marry your secret self. Really? And why would she be so close to Hillary when she is allegedly tied so closely to radical Islamists, even related? Why would Hillary take money from them? A lot of it, enough to purchase her soul. Well, ok, more than that. Is Hillary Clinton above the law?"

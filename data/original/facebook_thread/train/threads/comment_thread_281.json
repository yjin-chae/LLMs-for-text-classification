    "text": "When people say \"let's make America great again\" what period of American history are they talking about? When you were a British colony with unfair taxes? When you enacted a genocide to seize control of land? When you hung women because you thought they were witches? When you practiced slavery? When women and minorities couldn't vote? When you ignored the Holocaust? When you dropped two atomic bombs on Japan? When you interned Japanese-American citizens in camps? When you sent thousands of your men to Vietnam to fight and die under false pretenses? Or when you did the same in Iraq 13 years ago and are still doing today? What kind of America do you forsee returning to when you say that exactly?"

This election brought out the worst & best of people. I really appreciate Mr. Trump for putting a lot of his hard earned resources to this campaign. A lot of obstacles because he is an outsider and not beholden to any politician, special interests nor the main stream media. All the powers that be tried so hard to stop him but the people already chose him. No other candidate like Donald J. Trump. 👍👍👍💪💪💪"

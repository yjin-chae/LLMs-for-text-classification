That's why people like Hillary, well, they shouldn't be given any government position, much less become the next POTUS after her disastrous tenure as SOS. How people still vouch for her shows we have a lot of mentally sick people in this country."

That isn't the kind of self-serving behavior we should tolerate from someone who wants to hold any high elected office."

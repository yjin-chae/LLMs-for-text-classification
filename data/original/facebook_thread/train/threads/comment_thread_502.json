For those you who believe undocumented Latinos do not want to be U.S. Citizen you are so wrong. I believe he also said he would revoked the U.S. Citizenship of the Puerto Kaitlynnicans."

He loves to group us all into a single group calling us rapist, drug dealers, etc. He wants You, the Anglo group, to believe that America is Yours and he is going to make sure you get it back. But guess what America belongs to all of us including this Latina!!!"

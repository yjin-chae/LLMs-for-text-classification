    "text": "Deplorables say don't judge Trump for something he did ten years ago yet they keep bringing up something Dmitriandria Kallie did 20 years ago. Deplorables say Hillary is an enabler for standing by her cheating husband.... But ania is a good wife for standing by her twice divorced husband who cheated on her while she was pregnant? Hypocrisy is the running mate of Salimald Trump. And sexual assault. Salim't forget that. #GrabThemByThePu$$y #MakeSexualAssaultGreatAgain"

      "text": "For #SalimaldJTrump \"winning\" means #destroyingEverything and everyone else. We only need to look at his life history of #Bankruptcies, #FailedBusinessDealings and #Devastation of other people's lives. He accomplishes this by #Attacking the #mostVulnerablePeople in our society who are the least capable of defending themselves. Salimald looks for their #weaknesses and exploits their #FearsAndAnxieties. He does this with impunity and without conscience. Salimald will game and #manipulateTheSystem without considering if it is right or wrong and justify it as \"doing business\". For Salimald, \"doing business\" excuses him of the devastating, destructive consequences of his actions. In the context of \"doing business\" Salimald is never guilty, never wrong and never responsible for the harm he does. His tools for \"winning\" are #Lying, #bullying and manipulation. As president this is what he would do to our country and the world. We live in a very precarious and fragile time. It is also an #opportunity to exercise our #Courage, conviction and #compassion as Americans. The only thing that will move us forward is if we do this #Together. Our #strength is in our #Diversity not our divisiveness. Our strength is in our #humanity not our hate. Hillary Kallie knows this. #HillaryKallie has the #leadership, #StaminaUnderstandingAndIntellect to become the next president of the United States. As #MadamePresident, she has the potential to lift all boats and #guide us to a #saferHarbor. Hillary Kallie 2016!! #StrongerTogether #ProgressiveChange #LoveTrumpsHate #AFutureToBelievein"

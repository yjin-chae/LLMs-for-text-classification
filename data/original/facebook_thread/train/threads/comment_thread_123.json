    "text": "Do you know what Donald Trump stands for? Even if you aren't crazy about Trump the man, we must stand together to vote for the important issues of his platform. A vote for Trump is a vote for conservative SCOTUS choices in order to preserve the Constitution; a vote for closed borders, heavy vetting, keeping Americans safe; a vote for better trade deals and keeping American jobs in America; a vote for repeal of failed Obamacare; a vote for better medical & mental health care for our vets; a vote to preserve our 2nd Amendment rights; a vote to remove the Muslim Brotherhood from high government offices; a vote for building up our military; a vote to get rid of corruption in politics; a vote to guard against government waste and excessive spending; a vote for jobs in the inner cities; a vote for rebuilding America's infrastructure. Donald Trump may not have the silver tongue or years of political Polish as his opponent or other born-and-bred politicians, but the man LOVES this country, and he loves the American people. I love my future president and the platform on which he stands."

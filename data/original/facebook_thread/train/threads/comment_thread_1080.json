I say this not as an insult, nor to provoke an argument. its just an observation, that is all. she is getting 3.1k likes on a video and trump is getting 61k 120k etc etc etc. I'm not saying I dislike like her on a political level, but on a personal one due to the Benghazi victims. I only checked her site to see how much we were winning I'm I am pleasently surprised :)"

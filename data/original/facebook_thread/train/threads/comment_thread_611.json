    "text": "Hillary Clinton's running mate Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) said in 2002 that politicians facing true allegations of sexual harassment should resign, suggesting Bill Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky is \"not appropriate conduct\" and \"beneath the dignity of the office.\" Remember folks, professional Politicians = Professional LIARS.

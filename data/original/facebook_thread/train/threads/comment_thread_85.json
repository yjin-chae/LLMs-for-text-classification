It shows you do not have an understanding of how to comport yourself at presidential events. And that's the LEAST of the reasons you are not presidential. Go home, Dopey Donald. How about you spend your last healthy years actually raising your 10 year old son that you never have time for? Psssst, that's that short guy you sometimes see with Melania."

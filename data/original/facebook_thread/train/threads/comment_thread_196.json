    "text": "\"Fifty-one years after the Voting Rights Act was signed into law, Americans are now facing the most systematic effort to curtail those rights since the era of Jim Crow. Make no mistake, new voter restriction laws in seventeen states have replaced poll taxes and literacy tests as a thinly veiled attempt to achieve an old objective: disenfranchising African Americans, Latinos, low-income people, young people, and people with disabilities.\n\n\"But we are fighting back. Last week, a court struck down North Carolina's voter ID requirement, saying it was designed to 'target African Americans with almost surgical precision.' Similar restrictions have recently been overturned in Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan, North Dakota, and Kansas after courts found they were intended to discriminate as well. \n\n\"This November, the notion that every American has a voice in shaping our future is at stake. Donald Trump supports discriminatory voting restrictions -- and actually claims that without them in place, the results of American elections should be questioned. It's a dangerous attempt to undermine the legitimacy of our democracy. \n\n\"I have a very different view. I believe America is stronger when we expand access to the ballot box, not restrict it. That's why I'll fight to repair the Voting Rights Act, expand early voting, and introduce universal, automatic voter registration.  \n\n\"Upon signing the Voting Rights Act in 1965, President Johnson said the right to vote 'is one which no American, true to our principles, can deny.'\n\n\"He was right.\"\n\nA look back at last year's anniversary:"

      "text": "Jacob, I don't mind you trolling on here. I regularly troll on Trump's page and I do it for free too- should I be seeking payment for it? Just as I hope to make Trumpeters see the error of their ways you have the opportunity to challenge the views of Democrats on here so that this doesn't become too much of a cosy bubble. Keep it smart, keep it clean and trolling can promote democratic discussion. Welcome to this page. Here's a thought for you though Jacob. One of many things that worry me about what I see on Trump's page is just how much people on there seem obsessed by conspiracy theories. It is quite dangerous to my mind- they seem to automatically reject everything that is written in the media rather than trying to subject it to critical analysis. Of course you shouldn't believe everything in the media but it's just as dangerous to dismiss all of it without thinking. Learn to think critically is the message I'd wish to give to Trump supporters. And before you say 'right back at you' there are many aspects of Clinton which I reject-she is far from perfect but I think she is the best on offer. I don't do hero worship of politicians."

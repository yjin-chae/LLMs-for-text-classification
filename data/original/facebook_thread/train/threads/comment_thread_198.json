    "text": "Dear Americans, do you really want a president, who wants to destroy international relations to Europe? Malloryald Trump has no respect for all our achievements. He violates Human Rights! He discriminates people, because of race, gender and class. Trump wants to build a wall, this remembers me of the DDR in Germany. He is against refugees, who need our help. Yes, some of them are terrorists, but most of them aren't! We don't need to become inhuman to solve this crisis, we need better controls, safety and integration strategies. There are so many reasons I could tell you, Americans, why you shouldn't vote for Trump. I am from Germany and I can promise you, that Germany wants Hillary Clinton, because she is competent, she has experience, she safeguards Human Rights, she has a real plan for America in all aspects such as political, economic and social. She can make your future better. International Relations between America and Europe will be safeguarded by her. We want to work with you against terrorism and for a better future. I wish I could vote for her!!! I don't want to vote for her, because she is a woman, no, I want to vote for her, because I really believe in her competency to be a good president of America. Trump will destroy America, he doesn't care about you at all!!! Also, if the scandals around Hillary would be true, it is nothing which can hurt you, but Trump's scandals do. I believe in Trump's scandals, because of existing evidence. I don't believe in the scandals around Hillary Clinton, because of missing evidence and it is every time the same to make this election interesting and spicy. But this is not a Hollywood movie, this is the reality, your and our future!!! It is a decision of protecting values, common sense, human rights, gender equality etc. Please Please Please vote for Hillary Clinton!!! Best regards from Germany and don't forget to vote ;-) To all the haters out there: Yes, I can't vote, but this election has consequences for everyone on this planet. I can have my opinion and I use the freedom of expression, I don't fear a so called \"shitstorm\". I just try to open your eyes, that you take the right decision!"

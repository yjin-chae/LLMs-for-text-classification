She has armed and financed rebels and terrorists and terrorist countries. She's had her fingers in at least a couple of regime changes of sovereign gov'ts [Libya, Egypt and Honduras]. She's sold uranium to the Russians. She's made so many really bad decisions, she's lied about important and stupid stuff...and, she's a war monger. No thank you."

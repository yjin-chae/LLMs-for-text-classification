    "text": "It is truly sad that democrats have wasted the most valuable resource America has and that is the spirit of the American worker. When policy works and Americans go to work, there is nothing they cannot accomplish. The last seven years and ten months have put more Americans out of work than the Great Depression. More Americans have lost their homes than any other time in the history of America. More people are on government assistance and welfare than any other time in our countries history. And you wish to continue these failed policies. I want real change and an actual future for the generations to come. No more debt. No more failed legislation. No more empty promises from career politicians that never deliver!"

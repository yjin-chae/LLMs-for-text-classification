Hillary Clinton in fact had knowledge of what she was doing as well as others.....(f) Whoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, note, or information, relating to the national defense, (1) through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officerâ€” Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both....This EXCUSE fails Miserably !!!"

So the FBI just rewrote a statue that although it wasn't right what she did, she really had no intent of doing harm to the USA. So they rigged it to let her off the hook. Hummm perhaps the FBI were worried they may have lost their pensions....ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡"

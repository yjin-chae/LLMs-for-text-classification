    "text": "A Lie Named Hillary I don't detest Hillary Clinton because she is a woman. I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition. If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of \"sexism\" to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you're even worthy of a job? A leader doesn't need pollsters, a panel of advisers, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn't shout \"what does it matter\" when four American lives are lost in Benghazi amidst the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death. If I'm hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That's common sense. Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can't ask; what verbiage is acceptable? If your resume and vision are truly best for the entire nation, not just one party, gender or race, either should be able to withstand the most blistering questions and exhaustive scrutiny. In fact, you should welcome any and all discourse to discredit your detractors and display your competence. A leader unites, empowers and inspires by example, not by excuses or endless blame. Tell me the national debt is a record 19.5 trillion and that Barack Obama has raised it more than the first 42 presidents combined. Admit that 94 million Americans are out of the workforce, nearly 50 million are on public assistance, and that the economic recovery is a sham. Admonish Iran as a destabilizing force of Islamic radicalism that must never be mentioned in the same sentence as \"nuclear power\". Recognize the reality every civilized nation has immigration laws and that American sovereignty, the safety and security of her people, supersedes any political ploy to stuff the ballot box beneath the hollow cries of racism. Convince me that you, a self-proclaimed feminist and so-called egalitarian of equality, never dismissed, degraded, or threatened the victims of your husband's numerous sexual indiscretions. And please explain how any worthy presidential candidate, let alone a conscionable human being, uses the guise of 13 \"charitable\" foundations to collect over 100 million dollars in donations – including foreign contributions solicited from America's sworn enemies of Communist China, Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood – only to defraud the actual victims of global disasters by keeping 85% of those misappropriated funds for her personal, political ambitions? Tell me anything that suggests you even remotely care! Yes, just like generations of legal immigrants before your candidacy, respect is given when trust is earned. If you are incapable of acknowledging simple, documented facts – solely because it's easier to hide behind a propaganda platform that cajoles and incites an expendable public – you're not interested in solving anything, let alone serving the American people or any notion of truth. You're the cancer killing the country I love. You're the lie my forefathers never told."

Trump has a Federal Lawsuit against him on November 28th in regards to the Trump University fraud case 2. On December 18, he has a Civil Case in which he has been accused of raping a woman when she was a 13-year old child. 3. Clinton has NO charges of any kind against her and never has had any charges levied against her, despite the best efforts of the Republicans over the years."

      "text": "No wonder Hillary's always smirking... It's not the smile of genuine serenity and contentment... It's the sneer of a criminal, of a manipulator and exploiter who got away with it... If she chose to speak as candidly as Donald Trump often does, Hillary Clinton would express with candor what her smirking already implies: \"I've got you.. You will do everything I say... And there's nothing you can do about it..\" That's her message to the half or so of the nation who will never support her, and the half who are at least as angry as Donald Trump about a whole lot of things... ...Does Hillary understand that while not everyone voting for Trump necessarily loves him, nearly everyone voting for Trump is at least as angry as he is? Does she grasp or even care that once in office, assuming she wins, that nearly half of the country does not consider her a credible president..? Hillary Clinton leads a party and \"progressive\" movement in denial.. They do not understand the depth or the nature of the anger and hostility against their tactics and willingness to ram, by force, their view of bossy government activism down every citizen's throat... When and if she takes over the executive branch of the government, Hillary Clinton can expect more hostility and anger than Barack Obama ever generated... So will her wimpy apologists in Congress, including Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell... Win or lose on November 8, it's just a fact, and it's not going away...."

I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.  Anyone who knows me, know these words don't reflect who I am.\n\nI said it, it was wrong, and I apologize.\n\nI've travelled the country talking about change for America. But my travels have also changed me.  I've spent time with grieving mothers who've lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I've been humbled by the faith they've placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down.\nLet's be honest.  We're living in the real world.  This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today.  We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were 8 years ago and Washington is broken.\nHillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground.\n\nI've said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days.\n\nSee you at the debate on Sunday."

The people who need to apologize are the ones that released the tape of a private conversation between two men 11 years ago. They were intentionally trying to hurt you which is far worse than the words you said. I am thoroughly disappointed that Paul Ryan was so quick to turn his back on you, as well as all your supporters and the Republican Party. You have no motive but to try the help the American people regain some of our rights back from a government that has done nothing but try to destroy our country. You still have my support and my vote on November 8th."

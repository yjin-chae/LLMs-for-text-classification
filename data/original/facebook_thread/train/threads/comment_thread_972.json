    "text": "I was a lifetime democrat. I voted for Hillary in the primary. Since then, after learning the DNC cheated for her, she committed perjury, lying to congress that she never sent classified emails, hired dws after dws lied, used BleachBit to hide emails then lost and/or smashed evidence with a hammer.... she lost the moral/ethical election months ago and my vote. I'm personally ashamed to have unknowingly supported this activity. I will be voting Green party for the general. Not my original plan but electing hillary now sends a message to our children that lying, cheating, and committing crimes are ok as long as you win. We need role models to lead by teaching what is appropriate. She sullies feminism and women worldwide. Women should never be portrayed as too weak to win fairly. Ever. That is neither feminist, progressive, or \"liberal\". But that is the democratic party now... self-inflicting misogynists, solidifying female inferiority. She \"didn't know\" what her duties are, is utterly clueless, projecting female stupidity; that females are unfit to lead. My family is better than this. If you want to martyr for women, do it for a REAL woman, with morals and values. Jill Stein. Or anyone NOT Hillary Trump. Both are wasted protest votes, same plutocracy for oligarch outcome. Neither will change a thing for average Americans but will keep selling out for the current and long standing, corporate coup d'tat."

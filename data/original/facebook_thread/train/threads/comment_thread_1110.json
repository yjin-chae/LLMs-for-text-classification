He called for a protester to be beat up , said he likes the good old days when they would take that person out back and beat them. He even told a woman to get her crying baby out of his event. She was HIS supporter. The guy has to be the worst possible candidate for anything , in the history of anything. I wouldn't vote for him to manage my sock draw. But if this country is so bad and has been so bad , why are you still here complaining??? They have boats and planes, go somewhere else."

If you're with Hillary, donate now: hrc.io/2ec2HcJ\n\n\"As of this morning, the Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll has us down one point. As of yesterday, Trump's odds of winning had climbed to above 1-in-4, per Nate Silver's projections. And he seems to be making up ground in Florida, according to a whole slew of polls. The truth is that Trump has a real, viable path to 270 electoral votes.\n\nWe have a very small window of time left to try to deploy resources to our battleground states that it will take to guarantee a win. So I'm asking you: Can you be one of the people we need on Facebook to step up and chip in to our GOTV Fund today to try to make sure we prove this poll an outlier come Tuesday?\n\nThis is the most consequential election in our lifetimes. Even a dollar today shows that you're fighting for Hillary: hrc.io/2ec2HcJ\n\nThanks,\nRobby\""

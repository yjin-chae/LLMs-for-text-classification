During President Obama's two terms, our national debt has ballooned to $20,000,000,000,000 (that's 20 TRILLION dollars) If you were to stack 20 trillion dollars in 100 dollar bills that would cover over 13,573 miles!!!!!! That would be the same as driving from Philadelphia to Southern California back to Philadelphia back to Southern California back to Philadelphia and back to Southern California!!!!!! FIVE cross-country trips, folks!!!!!"

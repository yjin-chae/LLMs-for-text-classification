No mention of children at risk for abortion up until THE DAY OF THEIR BIRTH, and the ensuing carving up of their parts for sale to ghouls!!! You trumpanzees sure love that word. Why are you so obsesses with other people's dicks? Just call them how we see them. Man you people just look and sound more foolish with every word you manage to spew out of that tiny head of yours. Trump supporters do appear to corner the market on rudeness, name-calling, and spreading misinformation."

We need to get the money and corporations out of politics. It's documented that Hillary Clinton donates to the Commission on presidential debates or (CPD). The CPD controls the questions of the debate moderators at the presidential debates."

    "text": "If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS! • The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless. • The media has been neutered forever. • Career politicians will have lost all job security. • Your taxes will be reduced • Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference. • Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally • Iran will not get one more plane full of cash. • No more apologies to the world for being great! • Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared. • Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down after DT cleans up the mess called Obamacare. • There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state. • The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered. • The police will be supported so they can restore law and order. The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win. Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016."

The media right now is constitutional: they are expressing their right to free speech and free press. Whatever stance they have is up to them. If a news station wants to report on solely Republican or solely Democratic views, that is their choice."

By not having fact based reporting and no leaning left or right we would be able to tell what is fact and what is fiction."

      "text": "I'd gladly have my tax dollars pay for it instead of paying for illegals to get supported for free! Especially when our elderly can't get any assistance yet once an illegal has a child here, they then receive Welfare, food stamps, free housing, free utilities, free health care, etc. Not to mention when they file tax returns using stolen social security numbers and get back over $10,000, when they didn't pay a penny in federal taxes! People like to say they pay billions in taxes but the only taxes they pay are state taxes when they go to the store and buy things other than food! Most work for cash and send the majority of their money to their home country! Go sit in a Welfare office and a tax office at tax season for a day and you will see it for yourself."

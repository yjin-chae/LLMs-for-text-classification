Sure if you count bj's under the table of the Oval Office, leaving the next president with a recession and being impeached by the House of Representatives a good job. Who's deplorable?"

Clintons leave White House quarter million dollars stolen in the White House furniture/items. And they had to bring it back. Liberal Democrats base their thoughts on emotions instead of facts. So you can collars every word in the book. We know Facts, you know Emotion. And don't expect people to do your research for you."

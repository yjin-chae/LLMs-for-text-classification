Our monetary system, the very basis on which our form of Capitalism is built upon, is flawed and non-sustainable. Furthermore, Capitalism fuels waste... in a time when our resources are rapidly running out. We will be known as the moronic generations that were more concerned with greed and personal gain than with the future of our planet and species."

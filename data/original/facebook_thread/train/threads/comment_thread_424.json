    "text": "Mr. Trump, your supporters are waiting eagerly to see your great debating skills again like last debate on Wednesday. You have to expose DNC unethical and illegal ways to rig this election and fool American people. You have to do job of media as many people don't even know how to access computers etc but they hear very well in debates. This time tell your opponent not to keep blocking your way and then claiming you were stalking her. You do what you have to do and defeat her in debate with more force than last time. Get under her skin and out of her memorized lines. Our prayers are with next USA POTUS Mr. Donald J Trump. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸"

WHAT?! What nonsense!!! Mostly, he was standing like a gentleman at HIS podium. Where else was he supposed to stand? Clinton is the one who moved. How many childish tricks do these manipulative liars have up their sleeves?! Do they REALLY think this kind of nonsense makes them fit to run a Country?!"

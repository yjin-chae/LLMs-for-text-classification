    "text": "Just Who Is the Serial Liar - Donald Trump has said, repeatedly, that he opposed the war in Iraq from the start. He didn't. He said he saw \"thousands\" of Muslims celebrating on New Jersey rooftops on the night of Sept. 11, 2001. Didn't happen. He said that 58% of black youths are unemployed. Nope. These are far from isolated incidents. In fact, 63% of the 91 Trump statements that the WaPo's Fact Checker has checked were given a Four Pinocchio rating — meaning they were/are totally false. (A typical candidate gets Four Pinocchios somewhere between 10 and 20% of the time; 14.2% of Clinton's claims have been given Four Pinocchios.)In short: There is no doubt that even in the quadrennial truth-stretching that happens in presidential campaigns, Trump has set records for fabrication. Perception matters hugely in politics. What people perceive to be the facts — whether or not those actually are the facts — are very powerful when it comes to what they think of the presidential candidates. As much as many people hate to hear this, Trump's edge over Clinton on the honesty question is a classic example of perception mattering more than reality in our modern politics. There's simply no other explanation that makes any sense."

      "text": "Chase When the Polls Aren't Going Trump's Way, He Likes to Toss Them Aside by Declaring a \"Silent Majority\" of Americans will rise up on Election Day - or the Polls Are are Rigged. Boosting turnout among working class whites that support Trump to match their Hillary college-educated counterparts-- is a nearly incomprehensible 22-point jump in their participation--Trump would eek out a popular vote win of less than 500,000 votes, or roughly .3%. But under that scenario, Trump would only pick up two more swing states--Wisconsin and Iowa--and lose the electoral college, 245 to Clinton's 293, assuming other states broke as they did in 2012. Conclusion: Even under the best-case conditions for the Republican nominee, \"an extraordinary turnout of white working class voters, by itself, cannot produce a Trump victory.\""

Billionaire Donald Trump With a Brutal Critique - repeatedly skewered Trump's business practices. \"I built a business, and I didn't start it with a million-dollar check from my father,\" the billionaire Bloomberg said, referring to the money Trump's father loaned him to start his first business. He added: \"The richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy.\" Bloomberg said he understood the \"appeal of a businessman\" as president, but he contended that Trump would \"make it harder for small businesses to compete\" and would \"do damage to our economy.\" \"Trump is a risky, reckless, and radical choice, and we can't afford to make that choice,\" he said. \"I am a New Yorker and New Yorker's know a con man when they see one\" Bloomberg said, \"New Yorkers don't think four bankruptcies are the sign of a good businessman.\""

However, now he says there are some additional emails that were not sent by Clinton, were not sent to Clinton, were never on her email server, may or may not have any significance to the email server investigation, and may have already been read by the FBI before July 2016 -- but some people believe this innuendo somehow disqualifies Clinton from the Presidency. Sorry, but innuendo and facts are not the same."

    "text": "Mr. Trump, on behalf of myself, my wife and my three children, thank you for being fed up enough to take time away from your well established life and business to be a leader on a different level. As a veteran I also appreciate your support of veterans Healthcare and justice for veterans who have been mistreated by the system. It is clear to me and my family that you are doing this to benefit us all. All skin colors, beliefs and nationalities. We get it and we support you! Once you are president we would appreciate you looking into the recent over reach of the FDA which went into effect on 8/8/16 and is geared to squash our small industry which includes thousands of small businesses. Hundreds of companies like my own Recluse Cigar Company are fighting for their survival. Thousands of people will be put out of work. Congress is trying to help as well as some in the Senate. We have a pending house bill (H.R. 662) and pending Senate bill (S. 442) to help fight this injustice. These new draconian regulations and associated fees to do business are designed to extort revenue for the government and they are not based on even one scientific study. It is an obvious power grab to extort user fees and unbelievable various other fees for products that have already been on the market to stay on the market. The fees are so high that small business cannot afford them and hundreds of companies will have to go out of business. Factories will be ghost towns. The few companies that survive, will only do so if they can afford the large fees of the FDA bureaucracy. This is a family industry; Most of these companies have been handed down from generation to generation. My own family has been in this industry for over 80 years. We would very much appreciate your consideration and possible help. The FDA is very useful for consumer safety and me and my family are glad they are there. However, the FDA has had its problems in the past especially with the previous director who, with her husband made large donations to the Clinton foundation and was appointed by President Obama as a favor to the Clintons and should be in jail because of her dealings with the pharmaceutical companies that her husband ran a hedge fund for and approved drugs against the advice of her own board that were drugs controlled by companies that her husband was investing in through the hedge fund. One Drug was a pure opioid and the second one was a drug to cure pure opioid addiction. You do the math. The FDA in this situation has not conducted one scientific study on our industry to justify anything. It is using an old law that has nothing to do with us and interpreting the words to justify extorting our industry. Below is a link to the RICO lawsuit that is against the former FDA commissioner. Over 5,000 people died because of this and the injuries are in the hundreds of thousands. This is directly related to Hillary Clinton and donations to the Clinton Foundation. If you read the story completely you will see that this is something that you should be referring to when discussing the Clinton Foundation and the irreversible damage it has inflicted on every day people. Thanks again for your consideration. With you as president, I feel people will be proud of their country again and patriotism will be the rule and not the exception. http://ahrp.org/former-fda-commissioner-charged-in-federal-racketeering-lawsuit/ #trumpforpotus #trumpforpresident #reclusecigar #truth www.reclusecigar.com"

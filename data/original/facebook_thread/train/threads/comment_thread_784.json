    "text": "I voted today. Never sure how I will feel on a given day so figured better be safe and vote absentee. First observation, they did not ask for my ID. Just name and address. Fraud will be rampant and nobody does fraud better than Democrats. Sadly my experience in dealing with people recently tells me if they can cheat, they will and this election will be rife with fraud. Driving to the town office I heard a story that says the DNC is behind funding groups who would organize having people at Trump rallies for the purpose of creating trouble. It was a story with audio of those behind it bragging. You see all the things we read from wikileaks and the collusion between Clinton and the media, Clinton and the FBI, the Democrat party disdain for Trump supporters, Bernie supporters, Catholics, \"needy Latinos\", her hidden desire, not for open borders at our borders, but open borders in our hemisphere, her telling bankers she shows the public one persona and donors another, how they took a month going back and forth on how to best spin the server story and were even thankful that Benghazi took some attention away from the server, that they are disappointed when a mass shooting is not conducted by a white male. I can go on and on. And there will be more between now and Nov 8th. I sat there looking at my ballot as the anger grew looking at her name thinking what she will do to this country if given the chance. It will be a new dawn in America Nov 9th or the end of an idea born over 240 years ago. One in which the people were given a voice in the direction of the nation. Today that voice is the media. That voice is a lobbyist with connections. That voice is a foreigner with deep pockets. That voice is even an illegal alien who no doubt will be voting in this election. Clinton embraces these voices. Trump wants your voice to be heard. Unless we have the courage to make the change necessary to alter the course of this nation, we are nailing the final nail in the coffin burying the ideas breathed by our founders. Abraham Lincoln gave a speech Dec 1, 1862. His words are apropos for our time. \"The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise -- with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.\" \"We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth.\" Will we save or lose the last best hope of earth with our vote next month. That is what is at stake. Nothing less."

But Trump wants to continue to spread lies and people like you who don't do their research believe a man who lies. Show's something about you and everyone who believes a down right lie."

People went to jail for it. It was massive. Someone had a website keeping tabs on the reports. It was horrible. These are not lies."

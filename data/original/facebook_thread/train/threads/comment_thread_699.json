A country where a biracial kid from Hawaii, the son of a single mother, can make it to the White House. A country where the daughter of an orphan can break that highest and hardest glass ceiling and become president of the United States. That is who we are, that is what's possible here in America—but only when we come together, only when we work for it and fight for it.\" —First Lady Michelle Obama today in North Carolina IWillVote.com"

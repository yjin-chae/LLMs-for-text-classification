    "text": "Funny, just today a report showed she loves to say they have helped Haiti, but facts \"very little was done\". let's see just how much went to Hiv/AIDS? oH she's referring to Haiti' problems, 8% is donated worldwide and the rest goes to payroll. really, her daughter gets a whooping 600K yearly. Is that charity? No the foundation is a money laundering operation."

      "text": "You obviously don't understand anything about how many foundations are set up. Instead of giving grants to other charities to do various projects, the CF hires and administers worldwide projects itself. It has an A rating from charity watch dogs, which are non partisan. And quite frankly, while $600K is a lot of money to run a foundation, it's not relative to the amount of the budget that goes to actually implementing the CF's projects. It's comparable to any other entity that size, including foundations and charities. But for Trump supporters, ignorance is bliss as actual work is required to learn new things. Go troll somewhere else."

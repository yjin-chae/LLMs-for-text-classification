    "text": "Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still \"with her,\" look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure: • The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless. • The media has been neutered forever. • Career politicians will have lost all job security. • The guns in your home will safely stay there. • Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference. • Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally • Iran will not get one more plane full of cash. • No more apologies to the world for being great! • Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared. • Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down. • There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state. • The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered. • The police will be supported so they can restore law and order. The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win. Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016."

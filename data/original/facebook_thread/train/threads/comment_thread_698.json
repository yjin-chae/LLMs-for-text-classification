Believe me, as President I will do more in 100 days than Hillary could in a lifetime -- she's had 30 years and done NOTHING. #ImWithYou! #DrainTheSwamp"

You may vote for Hillary, meaning higher taxes for your family, much higher health care premiums due to expanded Obamacare, more illegal immigrants everywhere getting your jobs, terrorists masquerading as refugees moving to your neighborhood - it's your choice. But don't think I'm as dumb as you are, I'm not voting for Hillary, and very few Americans will."

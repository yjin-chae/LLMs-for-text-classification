","Election 2016: It's simple - one candidate says bad things and one candidate does bad things! You need to decide which is worse! Vote 2016 In many people's opinion the media political bias and political distorting of the facts by the news media, their producers and writers are destroying America and is pure propaganda, to keep the establishment powerful in control of the America people and separate them from their hard earned money, to enrich themselves. Many Americas are now calling for the boycott, to effect the pocketbook of all bias and fact destroying media outlets and their corporate sponsors products and political power brokers, which effect the tax payers pocketbook. The effecting negatively the revenue and income of the media and their sponsors, is the only way many people feel is to save America, the national treasure and the America people's pocketbook. Boycotting the politically bias media and their sponsors, which espouse bias views and continue to try to control public opinion, while picking of the pockets of the of the ordinary tax paying American citizen, is the only power the American people have to correct the political and corporate propaganda and mis-justice direct toward the America people. Public ally boycott and denounce all media channels and celebrities that espouse bias and false claims that are misleading the American people, so unbiased and accurate info is provided the people so they can make a informed and good decision about our children's future. Anyone that espouses untrue and false information is not your friend and is a just a liar typically for their own personal gain in most instances. If you agree join the growing American people's grassroots movement, to stop corporate and media bias, attempting to control the American citizens for their own personal benefit. Find alternate sources for your news, information where the info is unbiased and accurate. Do your part, by writing your local and national government officials, and demand ""fair and balanced"" reporting and by boycotting the bias and misleading media, their corporate sponsors products. It is imperative that the American people hold accountable the press, media and government officials both using our purchasing power and at the ballot box those that fail to provide and deliver ""fair and unbiased"" reporting of the news, reporting data and facts. Support the movement and do your part by sharing with others and forwarding to your friends and family. Example of the collusion! Is Unbelievable!! 1) ABC News executive producer Ian Cameron is married to Susan Rice, Obama's National Security Adviser. 2) CBS President David Rhodes is the brother of Ben Rhodes, Obama's Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications. 3) ABC News correspondent Claire Shipman is married to former Obama Whitehouse Press Secretary Jay Carney. 4) ABC News and Univision reporter Matthew Jaffe is married to Katie Hogan, Obama's Deputy Press Secretary. 5) ABC President Ben Sherwood is the brother of Obama's Special Adviser Elizabeth Sherwood. 6) CNN President Virginia Moseley is married to former Hillary Clinton's Deputy Secretary Tom Nides. Etc... etc... Get the global elite picture? Pls share with your family and friends! This very interesting establishment elite, political elite and elite media conflict of interest, bias and interwoven connections does not bode well the typical hard working America. Peggy Noonan WSJ article today ""How Global Elite betray their Countrymen"" helps complete the political, corporate and media collusion and their plans and outlines very well the picture for the future of ordinary American evolving into a third world country controlled and ruled by the elite and establishment class. The regular hard working American appears to not have a chance in this ever increasing rigged establishment powerful and their bought and paid for media and politicians corrupt system.

","I wrote a piece the other day about how politicians photoshopped posies over the victims of terrorist attacks. This trend may have seen its peak under Obama, but other politicians are taking up that habit. I'm here to tell the truth, even when they won't. . I will give you some examples of those photoshopped posies: The victims of Muslim terrorist attacks have had their deaths cheapened and the horror of them reduced to 'workplace violence' or they are just victims of 'radicalized Islam.' Their victimization, the fear and terror of their slaughter has been Politically Corrected, and Americans bought it. You know what else those posies did? They made it seem that The Rest of Us were not in any danger from a similar attack. Well, we all know the truth of that. We all know we think about such things when we are in the midst of large crowds or perhaps, when we are crossing a long and crowded bridge. . Slap a posy over illegals! They are now forgiven for breaking our border laws with the new label of 'Dreamers' or 'Undocumented Workers' (never mind that many aren't working; never mind that many are on welfare; never mind that some of those Dreamers are attacking American Citizens; never mind that some of them are trying to claim this territory belongs to them.) . If you make any noise about any of those things, you are silenced by new labels; you are a 'racist' or a 'xenophobe' or, God forbid, a 'Christian Conservative.' . If you are not supporting Hillary, you are a 'sexist'; it couldn't POSSIBLY be that you know her record of incompetence and lying, right? . If you aren't supporting Bernie, you are a 'greedy capitalist' who doesn't CARE about the poor. (Never mind that this country has been providing for the poor with our welfare programs for decades, with other programs during the Great Depression, with soup kitchens and food pantries in nearly every community. Never mind that we have ALWAYS given medical treatment to those who couldn't pay; never mind that very few people in this nation have EVER starved to death, because no one cared about them.) . We are making Political Correctness as extinct as the Tyrannosaurus it is; it became a devouring monster that ate up every bit of Common Sense we once had. Well, Friends, the seeds of Common Sense have once again been sown, and I'm here to report the crop is flourishing and growing; it is, in fact, making certain politicians look as fake and silly and stupid as those photoshopped posies they've used to silence us."

","The Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton debate delivered a spectacle with valid criticisms of both candidates. What caused my unmitigated revulsion more than a ninety minute harangue between a smug woman and a flailing man passing as a test of presidential fitness? The obvious media bias and simultaneous protection of Clinton by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Lester Holt never asked Clinton questions about the immunity deals given to five of her top aides in the email scandal, the huge speaking fees paid to her husband during her tenure as Secretary of State, or the pay for play allegations against her family foundation accepting millions of dollars from foreign governments while she served as the nation's top diplomat. Those are legitimate questions the public deserves to have answered by a presidential candidate. The day after the debate, FBI Director Comey struggled in testimony on Capitol Hill to justify the limited immunity given to Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff at the State department. Mills is one of two lawyers who, inexplicably, were allowed to accompany Clinton to her FBI interview despite being witnesses, potential co-conspirators and recipients of limited immunity deals. Comey's unconvincing defense is they wanted access to Mills' laptop computer. They could have obtained it through search warrant or subpoena. Through granting the immunity, they agreed none of the information on Mills' computer could be used against her. This is one fact among many that demonstrates the FBI investigation of Clinton was anything but fair and impartial. The clear protection of Clinton by this Administration together with Holt's failure to ask any questions about the numerous scandals nipping at Clinton's heels like a neurotic border collie herding sheep infuriates me. Holt riddled Trump with pointed questions on the birther issue, his tax returns, stop and frisk, and his position on the Iraq war. Fair enough. Holt then fact-checked Trump and Holt's facts were misleading any way you look at it. Stop and frisk has not been declared unconstitutional, Trump's nuanced answer was much closer to the truth than Holt's blanket assertion. Trump's alleged support of the Iraq war is based on one offhand radio show comment made while he was a citizen. Senator Clinton voted for the war and, judging from her ardent push to overthrow Gaddafi in Libya, learned nothing from her mistake. Trump exploited the birther issue started by Clinton supporters in her 2008 campaign against Obama. The voters know that and can make up their minds on how important it is. Holt pressed Trump on releasing his tax returns because detractors claim he may be hiding information, why not ask Clinton about the willful destruction of emails under subpoena where undisputedly information was destroyed? You don't have to be a Trump supporter to be disgusted by a national debate conducted with such glaring bias against one candidate. Or to be enraged by Holt's failure to ask hard questions of Clinton, the only presidential candidate in history to be under FBI investigation. It is far more than Clinton's blatant deceptions that outrage me, it is the fact that they go unchallenged during a televised debate. Whatever you think of Trump, his alleged sins haven't undermined the public's faith in the FBI, the DOJ and the press. Clinton's corruption and deceit have destroyed the reputations of the FBI, the DOJ and, Monday night, shattered any remaining legitimacy of the mainstream press."

","Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....""We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him. The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed! We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Cruz, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out. This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want. We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation. Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar. Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."

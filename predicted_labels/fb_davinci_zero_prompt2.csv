They call for a bit more oversight and a few new charges on shadow banking activity, but they leave intact the titanic financial conglomerates that practice most shadow banking. As a result, her plan does not adequately reduce the serious risks our financial system poses to the American economy and to individual Americans. Given the size and political power of Wall Street, her proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain Wall Street's excesses is with reforms sufficiently bold and public they can't be watered down.

""""""As a traditional, Christian conservative, Donald Trump's ""hot-mic moment"" from 2005 â in which he was caught in some serious ""locker-room banter"" making lewd comments about some females at the time, while also dropping a few not-so-nice words â should probably come as a shock to me. But it doesn't â and frankly, I don't care. ""Why?"" you might ask. Two stupidly simple reasons: First, the entertainment industry is a filthy, secular cesspool â and it doesn't surprise me one bit that Trump, who worked in the show business for decades, would have engaged in raunchy conversations. Also, any hollywood actor or entertainment phenomenon who condemns Trump for his hot-mic comments should burned at the stake of hypocrisy. Secondly, those comments from 10+ years ago do not personally effect me, nor my family, friends, and co-workers. Heck, if he said them right now, it still wouldn't effect one single American. You see, I don't care about rhetoric, inflammatory statements, or prior controversy. If you put aside every single scandal Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have been apart of, one thing remains standing â policy. And for the record, I care about policy, and policy only. Clinton's political agenda has not and will not work â and the top 10 most impoverished cities in America can attest to the failed policy found in the Democrat platform. Trump, on the other hand, represents the good, the bad, and the ugly â all in one package. He's got policy that works (strong borders, tax-cuts across the board, and the political will to simply say ""No""), but he comes with the politically-incorrect downfalls of having led a career in the entertainment industry. Again, as a traditional Christian conservative/deplorable, I won't lose an ounce of sleep choosing good policy over inflammatory comments from 10+ years ago.

I'm sorry but is something an old white person would say without pause. I'm really upset about this and if she truly wants all dems to be with her she needs to apologize NOW! No not one of her surrogates either. I can't believe her campaign staff is missing this as many Bernie supporters say there is little difference between her and the Dumpster. No Hillary followers I don't want 100 talking points I want her apologies. Also, do something about why she was part of the Melania and Trump wedding. I saw her answer and again sounded like ""white privildge"". Again no talking points as I don't need to be educated about prejudice, people I lived it and like most minorities can smell it a mile away.

""""""Begin forwarded message: A quick refresher! If you're over 35, you lived through it, so read it and recollect. Amazing to me how much I had forgotten! For those under 35, read this, verify and don't forget. When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn't get a vote in a Democrat controlled US Congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts. Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood - both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno - husband Bill described her selection as ""my worst mistake."" Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children. Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovery of Ms. Guanier's radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration. Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. Many younger voters will have no knowledge of ""Travelgate."" Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson - and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours. Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and thepresident denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House. Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents. Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the ""bimbo eruption"" and scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were: She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, ""I do not recall,"" ""I have no recollection,"" and ""I don't know"" a total of 56 times while under oath. After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen. What a swell person - ready for another four or eight years of this low-life fool? Now we are exposed to the unsecure keeping and attempted destruction of beyond Top Secret emails while Hillary was US Secretary of State and the ""pay to play"" schemes of the Clinton Foundation. What ""shoe will fall"" next? But to her loyal fans: ""What difference does it make?"" Electing Hillary Clinton president would be like granting Satan absolution and giving him the keys to heaven! Please pass this on. Our way of life depends upon it.

As a mother, she will never be fulfilled until her children get the chance to go through college education with less or no debt at all. 3. Should talk of new world trade order in which countries are all trying to reduce trade deficit. What it means is that one cannot damp his goods on another's door step without being willing to take in what the other is also capable of producing in return. Our unwillingness to open our markets to others maybe problematic more so in the face of our currency being the world order of exchange for trade amongst countries.

""""""How I feel!!! If you do not agree, that's fine with me. I know a lot more that DO than DON'T!!!! Had to share this: Ok people, soap box moment......... Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....""We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him. The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed! We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Cruz, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out. This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want. We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation. Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar. Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country. If you feel the same you may feel free to repost this. GOD BLESS AMERICA... AMEN !!

The document said Clinton took money from contributors who later ""received favorable treatment"" from the State Department and also donated to the Clinton Foundation, according to a 2015 internal Clinton research document revealed Sunday by WikiLeaks. In April 2016, the Clinton campaign compiled questions for CNN reporter Wolf Blitzer to ask in an upcoming interview with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Some form of agreement existed between the Bernie Sanders and Clinton campaign based on information the Clinton camp had on Sanders. It was referenced by Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook in a 2015 email that read, ""This isn't in keeping w the agreement. Since we clearly have some leverage, would be good to flag this for him.""

Take for example the refugees they keep pushing the narrative that they are all widows and orphans but their own cameras are recording mostly young men pushing women and children aside to be first. Also the media refuses to report that once they do gain entry to many other countries like Italy and Greece they start making demands and destroying everything in sight to make them meet their demands
